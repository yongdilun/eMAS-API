# Stateful Oracle Testing Tracker

Created: 2026-05-16

Branch: `codex/playwright-e2e-plan`

Purpose: living execution tracker for the stateful oracle hardening plan. Future agents should update this file before and after each implementation phase.

## Status Legend

- `Not Started`
- `In Progress`
- `Blocked`
- `Done`

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Test reality audit | Done | Audited current pytest, frontend unit/component, mocked Playwright, seeded Playwright, release, and synthetic tests. Phase moved Not Started -> In Progress -> Done during this pass. |
| 1 | Oracle schema and scenario bank | Done | Oracle schema validates. Bank includes SO-001 through SO-020 plus risk-ranked extras SO-021, SO-025, SO-027, SO-029, SO-030, and SO-035. Accepted-gap format is documented. |
| 2 | Stateful fake tool and commit harness | Done | Added reusable mutable oracle harness, focused SO-001/SO-006/SO-007/SO-008/SO-009 tests, and strengthened critical graph tests without starting Phase 3. |
| 3 | LangGraph state machine invariants | Done | Added focused LangGraph state-machine oracle pytest coverage for cursor movement, staged-write cleanup, approval boundaries, rejection, timeout, stale approval, distinct approval ids, and original-state cascade semantics. |
| 4 | Snapshot, timeline, and final response contract | Done | Added Phase 4 oracle contract tests tying graph actions, approvals, audit rows, fake committed state, SSE/timeline evidence, and final response copy together; fixed frontend stale-terminal-before-approval guard. |
| 5 | SSE contract and disconnect semantics | Done | Runtime and browser SSE oracles now prove order, reconnect, malformed recovery, disconnect, fallback, and terminal-state gating. |
| 6 | Seeded full-stack data and audit oracles | Not Started | Verify real seeded Go API plus Factory Agent state. |
| 7 | Non-seeded LangGraph browser proof | Not Started | Prove critical browser flows without seeded planner adapter. |
| 8 | Manual failure promotion workflow | Not Started | Every manual miss becomes an oracle or accepted gap. |
| 9 | CI gate restructure | Not Started | Put fast oracle tests in PR and heavier ones in release gates. |
| 10 | Ledger refactor decision | Not Started | Decide whether a durable operation ledger is needed. |

## Phase 0 Audit: Test Reality Audit

Completed: 2026-05-16

Scope audited:

- Factory Agent pytest tests under `factory-agent/tests`.
- Frontend unit/component tests under `eMas Front/src/components/features/chat`.
- Mocked Playwright tests under `eMas Front/e2e/specs`.
- Seeded Playwright tests under `eMas Front/e2e/specs`.
- Release and synthetic Playwright tests under `eMas Front/e2e/specs`.

Summary:

- Found more than 20 weak-oracle risks. The highest risk is not missing tests; it is tests with useful coverage but insufficient state oracles.
- Stronger seeded data-integrity tests now exist, especially `full-stack-data-integrity.spec.js` and `full-stack-prompt-workflow-regression.spec.js`, but they still prove seeded adapter behavior rather than real LangGraph browser behavior.
- Many older seeded, release, synthetic, and frontend unit tests can pass with wrong DB state, missing audit rows, stale timeline rows, missing approval evidence, or premature final responses.
- Several Factory Agent pytest tests use fake HTTP or monkeypatched graph nodes and therefore prove local mechanics only. They should remain, but must not be treated as product state proof.

### Weak-Oracle Tests Found

| Priority | File path | Test/scenario name | Current assertion weakness | Real bug that could still pass | Recommended replacement or strengthening action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Critical | `factory-agent/tests/test_phase5_final_validator.py` | `test_two_step_priority_cascade_requires_second_langgraph_approval` | Uses an in-memory fake job map and monkeypatched dry-run/commit nodes; no DB, approval table, audit rows, snapshot, timeline, SSE, or browser oracle. | Real API commit could mutate the wrong rows, omit audit rows, or project stale timeline/final response while this fake graph test still passes. | Keep as graph mechanic coverage, but add SO-001/SO-002 stateful oracle pytest using mutable fake backend plus approval/audit/timeline invariants, and seeded plus real-LangGraph browser proof. |
| Critical | `factory-agent/tests/test_phase5_final_validator.py` | `test_approval_interrupt_resume_commits_from_checkpoint_without_replanning` | Verifies only fake event order, one prompt count, and fake commit invocation. | Resume could use stale approval id, lose pending approval state, or write without persisted approval evidence. | Add checkpoint-resume oracle that asserts approval row, distinct operation id, commit idempotency, snapshot pending state, and final response after commit only. |
| High | `factory-agent/tests/test_phase5_final_validator.py` | `test_bulk_low_priority_jobs_are_selected_by_filter_and_staged_as_one_approval_bundle` | Fake read returns fixed rows and stops at approval payload. | Product could approve the right preview but commit a different set, skip rows, or report success without mutation. | Convert to stateful fake commit harness with before/after priority map, unchanged rows, approval id, and audit rows. |
| High | `factory-agent/tests/test_phase5_final_validator.py` | `test_complete_create_intents_are_collected_into_one_bundle_approval` | Asserts staged writes count only; no commit, created rows, audit rows, idempotency, or final summary. | Create flow could duplicate jobs, miss one create, or claim created rows that are absent. | Add create oracle with final DB rows, generated IDs, idempotency replay, audit, and summary matching. |
| High | `factory-agent/tests/test_phase5_final_validator.py` | `test_bulk_low_priority_jobs_are_deleted_as_one_approval_bundle` | Asserts selected delete bundle only; no post-approval delete state, audit, or unchanged-row oracle. | Delete flow could delete extra rows, leave target rows, or show success despite failed deletes. | Add delete oracle with initial/final row sets, audit, approval id, and final summary. |
| Medium | `factory-agent/tests/test_phase5_final_validator.py` | `test_incomplete_create_intent_is_not_added_to_bundle` | Checks one staged write and approval count, but no clarification/snapshot contract for the incomplete second intent. | UI could silently drop the incomplete intent and still show success for the whole user request. | Strengthen with explicit clarification or partial-completion oracle and final response wording that names the skipped intent. |
| Critical | `factory-agent/tests/test_phase19_prompt_workflow_regression.py` | `test_phase19_scenario_119_cascade_prompt_matrix_extracts_two_write_sets` | Calls private `SeededPlaywrightPlanner._phase14_cascade_priority_changes` directly. | Real LangGraph planner could split or execute the cascade incorrectly while seeded private parser still passes. | Mark as seeded parser coverage only; add non-seeded LangGraph graph test and real-LangGraph browser smoke for top cascade prompts. |
| High | `factory-agent/tests/test_phase19_prompt_workflow_regression.py` | `test_phase19_scenario_116_loto_wording_matrix_uses_same_rag_route` | Parser/intent helper only; no RAG retrieval, source projection, final UI, or generic-diagnostic oracle. | Browser could still ask for machine ID, lose source metadata, or show generic error. | Pair with seeded browser source oracle and backend RAG contract asserting source metadata in snapshot/timeline/final UI. |
| Medium | `factory-agent/tests/test_phase19_prompt_workflow_regression.py` | `test_phase19_scenario_118_route_selection_matrix` | Tool selection assertions only; no execution or data oracle. | Correct tool could be selected but called with wrong args, wrong route continuation, or stale final answer. | Add route-to-execution contract for machine, job, approval, and cancel categories with snapshot evidence. |
| High | `factory-agent/tests/test_api_endpoints.py` | `test_conversation_message_returns_completed_empty_plan` | Accepts `COMPLETED` empty plan and session_completed timeline; no final-answer/stale-answer UI oracle. | Empty final response could reuse a previous answer or hide missing assistant content. | Add snapshot/final-response contract and frontend turn fixture for empty completion. |
| Medium | `factory-agent/tests/test_api_endpoints.py` | `test_planner_clarification_returns_message_not_error` and related clarification tests | Several clarification paths assert `COMPLETED` plus message content, not terminal-state/final-response consistency. | Clarification could be stored as completed terminal success or wrong turn association. | Assert session phase, no plan/steps, assistant message role, turn id, and no stale final answer. |
| High | `factory-agent/tests/test_api_endpoints.py` | legacy read-then-write approval flow around `WAITING_APPROVAL` -> `COMPLETED` | Verifies step statuses only after approval. | Write could commit without audit evidence, wrong backend state, or stale approval cleanup. | Replace legacy status proof with stateful API oracle including approval row, commit result, audit, and DB final state. |
| Medium | `factory-agent/tests/test_api_endpoints.py` | `test_machine_tool_result_summary_is_operator_readable` | Asserts `COMPLETED` and readable message text only. | Snapshot/timeline/presentation could omit the tool result while DB message assertion passes. | Add snapshot presentation and timeline event assertions for the same result. |
| Medium | `factory-agent/tests/test_api_endpoints.py` | `test_read_only_machine_not_found_returns_operator_friendly_completion` | Treats 404 read as `COMPLETED` with friendly message; no UI stale-answer oracle. | Not-found result could be terminal success in backend while browser displays previous answer or wrong source. | Add final response and frontend fixture proving not-found answer replaces stale content. |
| High | `factory-agent/tests/test_api_endpoints.py` | write machine precondition/not-found tests | Checks approval/no-approval branches but not final state or audit after approval. | Approval card could be correct while mutation target check uses stale machine state. | Add precondition oracle with target snapshot, approval payload, commit block on 404, and audit absence. |
| High | `eMas Front/e2e/specs/full-stack-seeded.spec.js` | scenario 35 approval-required flow | Confirms visible approval and pending row exists; no approval id/timeline/snapshot consistency. | UI could render stale approval card or wrong approval id while `/approvals/pending` has some pending row. | Assert pending approval id matches UI card, snapshot `pending_approval`, timeline approval event, and expected bundle rows. |
| High | `eMas Front/e2e/specs/full-stack-seeded.spec.js` | scenario 36 approval approve resumes and reaches completed state | Asserts `COMPLETED`, `Run complete`, and text; no DB/audit oracle. | Approval could complete without committing the seeded job change or with missing audit. | Strengthen with before/after job priority, audit row, approval status, timeline, and final assistant summary. |
| Medium | `eMas Front/e2e/specs/full-stack-seeded.spec.js` | scenario 38 notification and activity SSE open and reach final snapshot | Only proves EventSource URLs opened and final UI appeared. | SSE order, duplicate events, missing timeline rows, or snapshot/SSE disagreement could pass. | Add SSE event sequence oracle with event ids, activity rows, snapshot terminal state, and no premature final response. |
| High | `eMas Front/e2e/specs/full-stack-orchestration.spec.js` | scenario 40 two approvals required before final execution | Checks two approval ids and final text, but not DB/audit/timeline/final consistency. | Second approval could be cosmetic while one commit or wrong commit happens. | Convert to SO-005/SO-011 style oracle with DB state after each approval, approval rows, timeline, and no final before approval 2. |
| High | `eMas Front/e2e/specs/full-stack-orchestration.spec.js` | scenario 41 rejecting the second approval stops without later execution | Verifies no final UI and rejected approval row; no DB/audit unchanged oracle. | Rejection could still mutate data or append audit rows while UI stays non-terminal. | Assert DB unchanged from baseline, no successful audit rows, snapshot pending cleared, and rejection timeline event. |
| High | `eMas Front/e2e/specs/full-stack-orchestration.spec.js` | scenario 42 approval timeout remains visible and non-terminal | Checks expired timestamp and still `WAITING_APPROVAL`; no stale approval mutation attempt. | Expired approval could still mutate if approve endpoint is called later. | Attempt approval after expiry and assert 409/expired row, unchanged DB, no audit, and safe final response. |
| Medium | `eMas Front/e2e/specs/full-stack-orchestration.spec.js` | scenario 39 ordered multi-step job plans | Timeline text order and step statuses only. | Steps could read wrong DB data or summarize stale/seeded text. | Assert read source rows, result payloads, final summary matches row ids/counts, and unchanged rows. |
| Medium | `eMas Front/e2e/specs/full-stack-sse-hard.spec.js` | scenario 47 out-of-order and duplicate SSE events | Checks no duplicate visible `Run complete`, unique activity ids, and `COMPLETED`. | Out-of-order activity could still skip a required transition or final response could come from snapshot alone. | Assert exact expected SSE/timeline event sequence and monotonic event ids; compare against snapshot activity. |
| Medium | `eMas Front/e2e/specs/full-stack-sse-hard.spec.js` | scenario 48 EventSource reconnect sends Last-Event-ID | Checks server connection log contains a last event id; no exact replay/duplication oracle. | Reconnect could replay old non-terminal rows or skip terminal row while final UI remains visible. | Assert rendered activity ids before/after reconnect, no duplicated semantic rows, and snapshot/timeline equality. |
| High | `eMas Front/e2e/specs/full-stack-resilience.spec.js` | scenario 51 stream drop mid-run recovers by polling | Accepts final `COMPLETED` and text after stream drop; no event contract. | Polling could fabricate completion while activity stream lost commit or error evidence. | Add disconnect recovery oracle tying stream drop, polling snapshot, terminal timeline, and final answer source. |
| Medium | `eMas Front/e2e/specs/release-validation.spec.js` | scenario 53 release path opens app through `/agent` | Visible machine text plus `Run complete`; no backend state or snapshot oracle. | Release proxy could route to a fake/old answer or wrong session. | Assert active session snapshot, message turn id, and tool result source for the release proxy path. |
| Medium | `eMas Front/e2e/specs/release-validation.spec.js` | scenario 55 static bearer disables EventSource and uses polling fallback | Confirms no `/events`, diagnostic text, and final UI only. | Polling fallback could show final text without terminal snapshot/timeline agreement. | Assert polling snapshot progression and terminal state before final answer is allowed. |
| Low | `eMas Front/e2e/specs/release-validation.spec.js` | scenario 58 release latency budget | Measures visible progress/final text timing only. | Fast stale response could pass latency while backend operation is wrong. | Keep as performance smoke, but do not count as functional proof; pair with state oracle elsewhere. |
| High | `eMas Front/e2e/specs/production-synthetic.spec.js` | scenario 72 machine status synthetic canary | Non-empty final response and visible machine text only. | Production canary could pass on stale cached answer or wrong source data. | Add read-only snapshot/tool-result evidence and session age/turn id checks without mutating production. |
| High | `eMas Front/e2e/specs/production-synthetic.spec.js` | scenario 73 RAG/source synthetic canary | Allows `sourceCount >= 0`; exact source metadata optional. | RAG could invent/collapse citations or omit required source while test passes. | Require at least one cited source for known seeded/local mode; in live mode record accepted gap with degraded severity. |
| Medium | `eMas Front/e2e/specs/production-synthetic.spec.js` | scenario 74 SSE-or-polling canary | Any progress plus non-empty final response passes. | SSE/polling can disagree or final response can appear before terminal snapshot. | Assert progress event precedes terminal snapshot and final UI; record transport path explicitly. |
| High | `eMas Front/src/components/features/chat/turns/turnAssembler.test.mjs` | `completed LangGraph plan without terminal event renders the plan summary` | Explicitly allows completed plan summary without terminal event. | UI could display final answer when backend never emitted terminal completion. | Add companion negative fixture: latest operation must not render final assistant answer until terminal event or terminal snapshot evidence exists. |
| High | `eMas Front/src/components/features/chat/turns/turnAssembler.test.mjs` | `completed approval turn prefers completed tool result over stale approval wait terminal text` | Picks a completed tool result but has no approval/commit/audit oracle. | Tool result text could claim success for a failed or partial commit. | Feed the assembler from oracle snapshots where final summary, approval id, and committed rows agree. |
| Medium | `eMas Front/src/components/features/chat/factory-agent/activityTimeline.test.mjs` | `injects execution summary when plan steps exist but timeline has no tool rows` | UI synthesizes "Updating job records" from plan steps when timeline evidence is missing. | Timeline omission could be hidden by a synthesized activity row. | Add warning/diagnostic or contract test that missing tool rows fail for mutating oracle scenarios. |
| Medium | `eMas Front/src/components/features/chat/factory-agent/activityTimeline.test.mjs` | `terminal snapshot fallback uses full timeline across user turns` | Merges terminal fallback across turns. | Old turn evidence could make the latest turn look complete. | Add operation-id oracle fixtures and fail when latest operation lacks its own terminal chain. |
| High | `eMas Front/e2e/specs/full-stack-prompt-workflow-regression.spec.js` | scenario 116/124/125 LOTO regression bank | Stronger than parser tests, but still seeded RAG/planner; no real RAG or non-seeded LangGraph proof. | Real route/RAG integration could ask for machine ID or miss source metadata while seeded adapter passes. | Keep as seeded regression; add backend RAG contract and one real-LangGraph browser case for M-CNC-01 LOTO. |
| Critical | `eMas Front/e2e/specs/full-stack-prompt-workflow-regression.spec.js` | scenario 119/120/121/125 cascade matrix | Good seeded DB/audit oracle, but powered by `SeededPlaywrightPlanner`. | Real LangGraph could still finalize early, reuse mutated source set, or skip approval 2. | Promote top cascade scenarios to Phase 3 graph invariants and Phase 7 real-LangGraph browser proof. |

### Top 20 Scenarios To Convert First

| Rank | Scenario | Why first | Target strengthening |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | SO-001 medium->high then original high->medium | Exact recent high-risk cascade bug; seeded proof is not enough. | Pytest LangGraph invariant, seeded oracle, real-LangGraph browser. |
| 2 | SO-002 high->low then original low->medium | Existing scenario 86 regression and broad operator risk. | Stateful fake plus seeded DB/audit/timeline oracle. |
| 3 | SO-005 approval 1 accepted, approval 2 rejected | Hidden continuation after rejection can mutate silently. | DB unchanged after rejection, no successful audit, rejection timeline. |
| 4 | SO-011 final response before approval 2 appears | Direct false-confidence pattern from `COMPLETED` checks. | Assert no final UI/message until all approvals and commits complete. |
| 5 | SO-010 commit succeeds but audit row missing | UI success without audit evidence is a release blocker. | Seeded audit oracle tied to approval id and row ids. |
| 6 | SO-009 partial bulk commit failure | Final response can claim full success despite partial failure. | Exact per-row success/failure, final summary, and audit checks. |
| 7 | SO-007 approval double-click and refresh replay | Duplicate mutations can be invisible in final text. | Idempotency key, one audit row, one DB mutation. |
| 8 | SO-008 stale approval after new user revision | Old approval can mutate changed session. | Approval invalidation, 409 replay, unchanged DB. |
| 9 | SO-012 timeline omits approval 2 | UI can lose intermediate approval while final status passes. | Timeline includes both approval ids in order. |
| 10 | SO-013 SSE completion before snapshot terminal | Browser can show final too early. | SSE/snapshot/final UI ordering contract. |
| 11 | SO-014 SSE reconnect duplicates old activity rows | Duplicate rows can confuse operators and hide ordering bugs. | Last-Event-ID replay oracle with stable activity ids. |
| 12 | SO-018 browser refresh during active approval | Refresh can lose or duplicate approval state. | Restore pending approval id and prove no duplicate execute. |
| 13 | SO-019 existing completed session restored | Stale previous answer can become new answer. | Turn/operation id fixture plus browser reload oracle. |
| 14 | SO-020 empty final response | Empty completion can reuse stale answer. | Backend final-response contract plus frontend fixture. |
| 15 | SO-021 LOTO with `M-CNC-01` | Manual wording miss affected normal chatbot use. | Parser, route, seeded browser, backend RAG source oracle. |
| 16 | SO-025 route confusion: LOTO vs machine status | Correct route matters more than final text. | Route-to-execution contract with tool/RAG evidence. |
| 17 | SO-027 user sends revision while waiting approval | Pending approval must not survive superseding turn. | Approval invalidation and unchanged DB oracle. |
| 18 | SO-029 Go API 500 mid-run | Generic success after backend error is dangerous. | Seeded/release oracle with no final success and no audit. |
| 19 | SO-030 Factory Agent restart or stream drop mid-run | Infinite busy or fake final can pass weak checks. | Polling/SSE recovery tied to terminal snapshot. |
| 20 | SO-035 real LangGraph no seeded adapter | Seeded adapter hides planner bugs. | Opt-in real-LangGraph browser critical suite. |

## Phase 1 Implementation: Oracle Schema and Scenario Bank

Status: Done

Updated: 2026-05-16

Scope completed in this pass:

- Added the initial machine-readable oracle directory: `tests/e2e/scenarios/stateful_oracles/`.

  - `tests/e2e/scenarios/stateful_oracles/so-011_no_final_before_second_approval.json`
- Added schema/contract validation in `factory-agent/tests/test_stateful_oracle_schema.py`.
- Each initial oracle includes the required fields: stable `SO-###` id, prompt, initial state, expected intents or route, approvals, intermediate states, final state, audit rows, timeline, SSE/snapshot expectation, final response, UI expectation, unchanged rows, invariants, required layers, and Phase 0 weakness.

Continuation completed in this pass:

- Added five more top-priority oracle JSON files:
  - `tests/e2e/scenarios/stateful_oracles/so-007_approval_double_click_refresh_replay.json`

  - `tests/e2e/scenarios/stateful_oracles/so-013_sse_completion_before_snapshot_terminal.json`
- Current Phase 1 scenario bank now covers SO-001, SO-002, SO-005, SO-007, SO-008, SO-009, SO-010, SO-011, SO-012, and SO-013.
- At this earlier continuation point, Phase 1 remained `In Progress` because SO-003, SO-004, SO-006, SO-014 through SO-020, and accepted-gap format documentation were still open.

- Documented the accepted-gap format in `docs/qa/manual_prompt_regression_bank.md`.
- Phase 1 is now `Done` because the first critical scenario bank validates, every oracle names required layers and a Phase 0 weakness/risk, and the accepted-gap format is documented.

Next action:

Start Phase 2 by building the stateful fake tool and commit harness from the oracle files. Keep the work oracle-driven and avoid product fixes until the harness exposes a reproducible defect.

## Phase 2 Checklist: Stateful Fake Tool and Commit Harness

- [x] Add stateful fake jobs.
- [x] Add stateful fake machine/RAG entities where needed.
- [x] Add fake transaction dry-run.
- [x] Add fake commit that mutates state.
- [x] Add audit row recording.
- [x] Add idempotency/replay behavior.
- [x] Add approval expiry/staleness behavior.
- [x] Replace fixed fake rows in critical graph tests.
- [x] Prove the previous cascade bug would fail.

## Phase 2 Implementation: Stateful Fake Tool and Commit Harness

Status: Done

Updated: 2026-05-16

Scope completed in this pass:

- Added `factory-agent/tests/support/stateful_oracle_harness.py` as a reusable mutable fake backend for oracle tests.
- Added `factory-agent/tests/support/operation_assertions.py` for shared final-state, audit, unchanged-row, and timeline assertions.
- The harness now supports seeded jobs, seeded machines, seeded RAG entities, original-vs-current state reads, dry-run bundles, approval lifecycle state, commits that mutate fake state, audit rows, idempotent approval replay, stale/superseded approval rejection, expired approval rejection, partial bulk failure with per-row results, and timeline/SSE-style event capture.
- Added `factory-agent/tests/test_stateful_oracle_harness.py` with focused coverage for:
  - SO-001 original-state cascade.
  - SO-006 second approval timeout.
  - SO-007 approval double-click and refresh replay.
  - SO-008 stale approval after user revision.
  - SO-009 partial bulk commit failure.
- Replaced the local fake job-priority map in `factory-agent/tests/test_phase5_final_validator.py::test_two_step_priority_cascade_requires_second_langgraph_approval` with the shared oracle harness.
- Strengthened `factory-agent/tests/test_planner_phase3.py` with a harness-backed snapshot-selection guard proving captured original rows remain usable after the fake backend mutates.
- No product behavior was changed. `factory-agent/factory_agent/testing_seeded_adapters.py` was inspected as Phase 2 context but did not need modification for the pytest harness.

Next action:

Start Phase 3 only after reviewing whether the new Phase 2 harness should be wired into additional low-level graph invariant tests. Do not broaden into snapshot/SSE/UI contract work until Phase 3 is explicitly started.

## Phase 3 Checklist: LangGraph State Machine Invariants

- [x] Add `test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py`.
- [x] Assert no completion with active intent.
- [x] Assert no completion with pending approval.
- [x] Assert staged writes clear after successful commit.
- [x] Assert approval rejection stops continuation.
- [x] Assert approval timeout does not mutate.
- [x] Assert user revision invalidates stale approval.
- [x] Assert multi-approval flows create distinct approval ids.
- [x] Assert original-state semantics for cascade oracles.

## Phase 3 Implementation: LangGraph State Machine Invariants

Status: Done

Updated: 2026-05-16

Scope completed in this pass:

- Added `factory-agent/tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py`.
- Covered successful-commit cursor semantics directly at `make_final_validator_node`: a successful commit with another active intent routes back to planning, advances the cursor, marks the committed intent complete, and clears staged writes through the reducer replacement marker instead of completing the operation.
- Covered SO-011 with a harnessed real LangGraph run: first approval raises an approval interrupt without terminal events; first commit produces the second approval, not completion; approval ids are distinct; terminal state appears only after approval 2 commits.
- Covered SO-001 with a harnessed real LangGraph run: the cascade snapshots medium and high source groups before the first write and stages the second approval from original high rows only, even after current high rows include the newly changed medium rows.
- Covered SO-005 with a harnessed real LangGraph run: rejecting the second approval does not call the second commit path, does not create audit rows for the rejected approval, and does not record operation completion.
- Covered SO-006 with a harnessed real LangGraph run through the second pending approval, then an oracle timeout transition proving late approval is rejected and no second mutation or completion occurs.
- Covered SO-008 with the Phase 2 oracle harness: a user revision supersedes the old pending approval, stale replay is rejected, only the new approval commits, and old approval audit/commit evidence remains absent.
- Added explicit oracle-validity controls that intentionally construct bad states and confirm the Phase 3 assertions go red for:
  - `COMPLETED` while active intents, staged writes, or pending approvals remain.
  - Missing second approval plus premature `final_response_created` / `operation_completed`.
  - Mutating job state before approval.
  - Using current-state rows for the second cascade source set instead of original-state rows.
  - Reusing the first approval id for the second approval.
  - Claiming final success after a rejected second approval without commit/timeline evidence.
- No product code was changed and no product defect was found during Phase 3.

Start Phase 4: Snapshot, Timeline, and Final Response Contract. Keep Phase 4 focused on backend projection/final-response/timeline agreement and do not broaden into SSE or browser work until the Phase 4 contract is complete.

## Phase 4 Checklist: Snapshot, Timeline, and Final Response Contract

- [x] Add backend snapshot contract tests.
- [x] Add final response contract tests.
- [x] Add timeline event order tests.
- [x] Add approval id visibility tests.
- [x] Add final summary vs committed rows tests.
- [x] Add frontend turn assembler fixture tests from same oracle snapshots.
- [x] Add activity timeline fixture tests from same oracle snapshots.
- [x] Block stale previous answer display.

## Phase 4 Implementation: Snapshot, Timeline, and Final Response Contract

Status: Done

Updated: 2026-05-16

Scope completed in this pass:

- Added `factory-agent/tests/test_snapshot_timeline_final_response_contract.py`.
- Added a Phase 4 evidence contract that compares graph actions, projected timeline events, SSE-style events, approvals, audit rows, committed fake state, pending approval state, and final assistant response text.
- Covered SO-001 with the known hard regression prompt:
  `change all medium priority job to high then change all high priority job to medium`
- SO-001 now requires approval 1, approval 2, final completion only after approval 2, original-state semantics for the second write set, and final summary agreement with committed state, audit rows, timeline, and SSE evidence.
- Covered SO-011 so a multi-step workflow cannot emit final completion after only approval 1.
- Covered SO-005 so rejected approval 2 cannot produce hidden commit evidence or success wording.
- Covered SO-009 so partial bulk failure is reported as partial failure and cannot claim full success.
- Added negative-control/oracle-validity checks proving the Phase 4 contract fails on:
  - empty or missing timeline evidence,
  - missing approval 2 evidence,
  - premature final response ordering,
  - duplicate SSE ids,
  - stale approval ids in final response,
  - duplicate/reused approval request evidence,
  - false success after rejection,
  - false full success after partial failure.
- Fixed a frontend product bug in `turnAssembler.js`: a stale `session_completed` event from approval 1 could outrank a newer pending approval 2 when computing the visible turn summary.
- Added frontend unit coverage proving a newer pending approval outranks stale terminal completion and activity timeline stays in `Waiting for approval` instead of showing `Run complete`.
- No backend product code was changed in Phase 4; the new backend contract tests passed against the current harness and graph mechanics.

- `eMas Front/src/components/features/chat/turns/turnAssembler.test.mjs`
- `eMas Front/src/components/features/chat/factory-agent/activityTimeline.test.mjs`

Decisions made:

- Phase 4 treats timeline/SSE/final-response disagreement as an oracle failure, not as acceptable projection fallback.
- Final response copy for mutating oracle scenarios must cite actual approval ids; stale or invented ids fail the contract.
- Empty or synthesized timeline evidence is not enough for mutating oracle scenarios, even if plan steps or final status look complete.
- Partial failures may be terminal, but they must use partial/error wording and name failed rows; they cannot use full-success wording.

Blockers/open questions:

- No Phase 4 blockers remain.
- Phase 5 still needs dedicated runtime SSE reconnect/disconnect/malformed-event coverage beyond the harness-style SSE evidence used here.

Next action:

Start Phase 5: SSE Contract and Disconnect Semantics. Keep the next pass focused on stream order, reconnect, malformed payload recovery, duplicate suppression, and disconnect/polling behavior.

## Phase 5 Checklist: SSE Contract and Disconnect Semantics

- [x] Assert activity SSE event order.
- [x] Assert notification SSE snapshot invalidation.
- [x] Assert malformed SSE payload recovery.
- [x] Assert reconnect with `Last-Event-ID`.
- [x] Assert no duplicate activity rows after reconnect.
- [x] Assert stream drop leads to polling or safe diagnostic.
- [x] Assert modal close/navigation disconnects EventSource.
- [x] Assert SSE cannot force final UI before terminal snapshot.

## Phase 5 Implementation: SSE Contract and Disconnect Semantics

Status: Done

Updated: 2026-05-16

Pre-edit checkpoint:

- User asked to commit before editing Phase 5.
- Committed the existing worktree first: `527c9ea chore: checkpoint stateful oracle phases`.
- Phase 5 edits were made after that checkpoint.

Scope completed in this pass:

- Fixed a runtime SSE reconnect defect in `factory-agent/factory_agent/api/routers/events.py`: activity and semantic streams now only treat events as already seen when the supplied `Last-Event-ID` is found in the current snapshot/timeline. A stale or unknown `Last-Event-ID` now replays current evidence instead of suppressing every current row.
- Rebuilt `factory-agent/tests/test_event_stream_runtime.py` into a stronger runtime oracle:
  - notification stream poll sessions are separated from the auth dependency session,
  - activity reconnect resumes after `Last-Event-ID` without duplicate rows,
  - stale activity `Last-Event-ID` replays current ordered rows,
  - notification reconnect invalidates stale snapshot cursors,
  - semantic stream reconnect ties emitted events back to snapshot timeline order,
  - negative controls prove the assertions fail for duplicate, out-of-order, missing, and non-invalidating stream evidence.
- Added mock-server SSE frame logging via `eMas Front/e2e/mock-server/factoryAgentMockServer.js` and exposed `/__test/sse-events` so browser tests can assert actual emitted frames, ids, payload types, raw malformed frames, and ordering.
- Strengthened mocked Playwright `@sse` coverage:
  - `chat-sse-activity.spec.js` asserts monotonic unique activity frame ids, expected rendered order, snapshot terminal state, snapshot activity rows, timeline order, and no final answer before terminal snapshot.
  - `chat-sse-notification.spec.js` asserts notification frames include `snapshot_invalidated` and that a snapshot refresh happens after the invalidation frame.
  - `chat-stream-errors.spec.js` asserts malformed raw SSE is ignored, the next valid invalidation refreshes the snapshot, and stream drop produces safe polling diagnostics plus post-drop polling.
  - `chat-cancel-navigation.spec.js` asserts modal close disconnects both notification and activity EventSource streams.
- Strengthened seeded Playwright SSE/resilience coverage:
  - `full-stack-sse-hard.spec.js` now ties seeded activity rows to snapshot/timeline order, uniqueness, terminal state, and reconnect evidence.
  - `full-stack-resilience.spec.js` now proves stream-drop recovery ends in a terminal snapshot with one terminal activity row, ordered timeline evidence, and reconnect `Last-Event-ID`.
- Fixed one unrelated assertion drift encountered by the recommended seeded grep: scenario 52's no-source RAG test now accepts the actual safe wording `available cited LOTO source` instead of requiring the narrower contiguous phrase `available cited source`.

- `eMas Front/e2e/specs/full-stack-sse-hard.spec.js`

Decisions made:

- A stale or unknown `Last-Event-ID` must not mark every current activity/timeline row as seen; current evidence should replay rather than stall.
- Browser final-answer visibility remains snapshot-gated. SSE activity can show progress, but final answer and terminal activity require terminal snapshot/timeline evidence.
- Notification `snapshot_invalidated` is the core refresh contract. A later `phase_changed` frame is useful but optional once the invalidation refresh reaches terminal state and the client closes the stream.
- Seeded full-stack timeline oracles should assert the event sequence that the seeded stack actually projects (`plan_created` -> `tool_result` -> `session_completed`) instead of requiring `execution_started` where that projection is absent.
- Mocked SSE tests now inspect emitted frames through `/__test/sse-events`; visible busy UI alone is not treated as stream correctness evidence.

Blockers/open questions:

- No Phase 5 blockers remain.
- Phase 5 still does not prove non-seeded real LangGraph browser behavior; that remains Phase 7.
- The durable operation ledger question remains open for Phase 10.

Next action:

Start Phase 6: Seeded Full-Stack Data and Audit Oracles. Keep Phase 6 focused on seeded DB state, approval rows, audit rows, unchanged rows, snapshot/timeline/final UI agreement, and failure artifacts.

## Phase 6 Checklist: Seeded Full-Stack Data and Audit Oracles

- [ ] Reset seeded DB per oracle.
- [ ] Capture initial state artifact.
- [ ] Capture approval rows after each approval.
- [ ] Capture audit rows after each commit.
- [ ] Capture final DB state.
- [ ] Capture final snapshot/timeline.
- [ ] Assert unchanged rows.
- [ ] Assert final UI summary matches committed rows.
- [ ] Export debug bundle on failure.

## Phase 7 Checklist: Non-Seeded LangGraph Browser Proof

- [ ] Add real LangGraph Playwright project or opt-in spec.
- [ ] Start seeded Go API.
- [ ] Start Factory Agent without `SeededPlaywrightPlanner`.
- [ ] Prepopulate tool registry healthily.
- [ ] Drive SO-001 through the browser.
- [ ] Assert approval 1 card.
- [ ] Assert approval 2 card.
- [ ] Assert final UI and backend state.
- [ ] Add at least four more critical non-seeded browser cases after SO-001 is stable.

## Phase 8 Checklist: Manual Failure Promotion Workflow

- [ ] Add manual failure intake template.
- [ ] Require exact prompt and artifact link.
- [ ] Require observed failure and expected behavior.
- [ ] Require selected oracle or new oracle.
- [ ] Require lowest useful test layer.
- [ ] Require owner/severity.
- [ ] Require failing regression before closing.
- [ ] Review regression bank weekly until stable.

## Phase 9 Checklist: CI Gate Restructure

- [ ] Add fast backend oracle pytest command to PR gate.
- [ ] Keep mocked Chromium in PR gate.
- [ ] Keep seeded data oracles in release/pre-merge gate.
- [ ] Keep real LangGraph browser as opt-in or release gate.
- [ ] Keep production synthetic read-only.
- [ ] Upload oracle artifacts on failure.
- [ ] Document local run commands.

## Phase 10 Checklist: Ledger Refactor Decision

- [ ] Review recurring projection failures.
- [ ] Decide if durable operation ledger is required.
- [ ] If yes, write migration/design plan.
- [ ] If no, document why existing projections are now stable.
- [ ] Keep invariant tests either way.

## Current Blockers

- Existing phase docs mark many phases `Done`, but recent bugs prove several tests had weak oracles.
- Some seeded Playwright tests prove seeded adapters, not real LangGraph behavior.
- No Phase 5 blockers remain.
- The worktree contains Phase 5 changes made after checkpoint commit `527c9ea`; future agents must avoid reverting them unless explicitly asked.

## Open Questions

- Should all cascading bulk mutations default to original-state semantics? Current plan says yes unless the oracle explicitly says current-state semantics.
- Which five scenarios must get non-seeded LangGraph browser coverage first? Proposed: SO-001, SO-005, SO-011, SO-021, SO-034.
- Is a durable operation ledger required, or can invariant tests stabilize current projections?
- Which CI workflow should block release branches for seeded oracle failures?

## Decisions Made

- Improve the current test stack instead of replacing it.
- Treat weak tests as test defects.
- Use stateful oracles for critical scenarios.
- Do not rely on real LLM calls in deterministic CI.
- Keep Promptfoo/LLM evaluation out of this core contract plan until state, SSE, timeline, and final-response contracts are stable.
- Stop phase progression when a reproducible defect is found.
- For mutating workflows, `COMPLETED` is not sufficient. DB, audit, approvals, timeline, snapshot, final response, and UI must agree.
- For Phase 4 mutating workflows, empty or synthesized timeline evidence is a failing oracle condition.
- A newer pending approval must outrank any stale terminal completion row in frontend turn summaries and activity timelines.
- For Phase 5 stream recovery, stale or unknown `Last-Event-ID` replays current evidence instead of suppressing all rows.
- SSE activity evidence can advance progress UI, but final assistant UI remains gated on terminal snapshot/timeline state.
