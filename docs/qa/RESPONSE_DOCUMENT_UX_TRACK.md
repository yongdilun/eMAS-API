# Response Document UX And Final Response Quality Tracker

Branch: `codex/playwright-e2e-plan`
Created: 2026-05-18

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Status | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Response gap audit and contract inventory | Completed | Codex | Current backend/frontend response paths, existing coverage, missing gates, blockers, and Phase 1 starting point documented below. |
| 1 | Backend response document schema | Done | Codex | Added additive backend `response_document.version=1`, `run_steps`, typed blocks, snapshot revision, and backend contract tests. |
| 2 | Deterministic composer and run steps | Done | Codex | Added backend-owned deterministic composer, run-step evidence, completed-step preservation, read/RAG/no-result blocks, and Phase 2 contract tests. |
| 3 | Failure recovery response documents | Done | Codex | Added typed failure taxonomy, operator-friendly diagnostic cards, sanitized technical details, impact/retry policies, and failure-focused backend tests. |
| 4 | Frontend response document renderer | Done | Codex | Added frontend response-document normalizer/renderer, direct block rendering, compact approvals, invalid-document diagnostic, fallback only when missing, unit/component coverage, and a focused mocked Playwright proof. |
| 5 | Response document reducer and busy-traffic ordering | Done | Codex | Added centralized frontend response-document reducer, shared SSE/polling snapshot ordering path, stale/invalid revision guards, focused reducer tests, and mocked busy-traffic Playwright coverage. |
| 6 | Final response quality E2E gate | Done | Codex | Added mocked browser final-response quality gate for cascades, reads, RAG/source, diagnostics, rejected/expired/stale/cancelled states, and busy traffic convergence. |
| 7 | Compact approval and progressive disclosure hardening | Done | Codex | Hardened typed approval/result/diagnostic progressive disclosure, duplicate table suppression, controlled collapse state, and mobile/desktop overflow checks. |
| 8 | Mandatory compatibility cleanup | Done | Codex | Isolated legacy presentation/table heuristics behind missing-document fallback and added guardrails for valid/invalid `response_document`. |
| 9 | Release gate and future LLM handoff | Done | Codex | Added response-document release lane and documented blocking/non-blocking gates, manual limits, and future LLM polish contract. |
| 10 | Orphan turn and session state invariant gate | Done | Codex | Added backend orphan-turn invariant, typed `planner_no_action` / `orphan_turn_state` diagnostics, and mocked browser state-agreement coverage for the Chat 514 class. |
| 11 | Real flow browser state-transition oracle | Done | Codex | Added reusable browser transition oracle, mocked RD-001/RD-002 coverage, and real LangGraph SO-041 proof; fixed stale revision/session and completed-approval copy bugs found by the oracle. |
| 12 | Semantic snapshot probe and artifact quality | Done | Codex | Added compact semantic probe helper, oracle failure attachments, diagnosis classification, redaction/size tests, and a browser artifact proof. |
| 13 | Manual screenshot regression intake | Done | Codex | Added strict screenshot intake template, structured Chat 514 regression entry, and a bank gate that rejects vague/manual-only screenshot issues. |
| 14 | Final response business contract | Not Started | Codex | Backend `response_document` must emit clean business-level mutation results: grouped changes, deduped affected records, compact preview, and no raw assistant/internal-id noise. |
| 15 | Final response visual quality oracle | Not Started | Codex | Browser semantic oracle must prove the rendered final response is compact, grouped, expandable, and free of raw/internal noise. |

## Current Blockers

- Chat 514 style orphan state is fixed and covered by Phase 10 backend plus mocked browser regressions. Normal prompts must not settle as `IDLE/non_terminal_snapshot` with generic `Needs attention`.
- RD-001 final mutation result can still render noisy raw/internal response content: `done_all`, giant duplicate tables, wrong aggregate counts such as `Updated 63 jobs across 22 approved steps`, and internal fields such as `Operation ID`, `Step ID`, or `Row ID`.
- Existing `PresentationResponse` remains in the API only for compatibility snapshots where `response_document` is absent.
- Real LangGraph and seeded suites remain broader release gates; focused response-document mocked browser coverage is now the fast UX lane.

## Open Questions

- Should `response_document` live directly on the snapshot response, timeline terminal event, or both?
- Which backend module should own composition: `session_snapshot_service.py` or a new `response_document_service.py`?
- Should any privileged support-only UI ever expose operation/step ids, or should they stay only in probe artifacts/backend logs?
- Should expanded/collapsed state be keyed by block id, approval id, or operation id?
- Which real LangGraph scenario should be the first non-seeded proof after Prompt A: Prompt B, partial failure, or RAG/source answer?
- What coalescing strategy is best after implementation: next animation frame, 50ms debounce, or 100ms debounce?
- Which failure actions are safe to expose first: retry from checkpoint, check status, start new request, or view diagnostics only?

## Decisions Made

- Final response truth is deterministic backend evidence, not LLM narrative.
- No LLM final-response layer is included in this plan.
- Response output should be typed blocks only; markdown is not the UI contract.
- Backend owns `response_document` and `run_steps`.
- Frontend renders block types and does not infer state/layout from prose when `response_document` exists.
- UX pattern is compact run activity plus short conversational message plus compact action/result cards.
- Completed step evidence stays visible when a later approval is pending.
- Latest pending approval is visually primary.
- Approval cards are compact by default and expandable for records/details.
- Progressive disclosure is the standard: short default, auditable details on demand.
- The first flagship scenario is multi-step two-approval mutation.
- Cover both cascade directions; implement Prompt A first, then Prompt B.
- Any product bug found blocks the phase until fixed.
- Additive migration is allowed only with a mandatory cleanup phase.
- Latest valid `response_document.revision` is the frontend source of truth under busy traffic.
- Backend should prevent stale snapshots, but frontend must still refuse stale documents.
- Do not merge older frontend revisions into newer documents.
- Use both session-level `snapshot_revision` and per-turn `response_document.revision`.
- Highest valid revision wins regardless of SSE or polling transport.
- If `response_document` exists but is invalid, render a safe diagnostic and report/log the contract violation; do not use old `presentation` as fallback.
- Centralized frontend `responseDocumentReducer` or equivalent store update function owns incoming document validation, ordering, coalescing, and collapse preservation.
- Backend owns monotonic response-document revision generation.
- Block ids must be deterministic and derived from operation, approval, step, or source identity.
- Backend owns block lifecycle; frontend does not preserve removed blocks as invented history.
- Busy-traffic tests should use reducer/unit tests plus Playwright event-storm convergence tests and failure artifacts.
- Broken flows render typed operator-friendly failure cards with cause, impact, current state, and next actions.
- Failure handling uses typed failure reasons and deterministic templates.
- Technical diagnostics are collapsed and sanitized by default.
- Failure-card actions are context-aware and gated by safety/retry policy.
- Partial-progress failures show both completed progress and failure impact.
- Normal user prompts must never settle into an orphan `IDLE/non_terminal_snapshot` state. They must be running, waiting approval/confirmation, completed, cancelled, blocked, or failed with a typed reason.
- Browser tests must compare visible UI with backend snapshot state at transition checkpoints, not only final backend JSON.
- Compact semantic probes should be the primary failure artifact; full Playwright/a11y snapshots are supporting evidence.
- Completed mutation final responses use a short summary, grouped business changes, and a compact affected-record preview.
- The default affected-record preview limit is 5 rows, with expandable clean audit details.
- Expanded affected records are grouped by business change, not backend operation or step id.
- Raw assistant final markdown is not display truth for mutation results.
- Internal ids such as `operation_id`, `step_id`, and `row_id` do not appear in normal rendered chat.
- Final mutation aggregates are based on business write sets, not individual backend operations, execution steps, tool calls, or audit rows.

## Flagship Inputs

| ID | Prompt | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RD-001 | `change all medium priority job to high then change all high priority job to low` | First flagship. Proves approval 1, approval 2, completed-step preservation, latest pending approval, and final aggregate result. |
| RD-002 | `change all high priority job to low then change all low priority job to medium` | Reverse cascade. Proves original-state semantics and prevents overfitting RD-001. |
| RD-003 | `change all medium priority job to high then change all high priority job to low` | Post-gate orphan-state regression. Proves the flow cannot show `IDLE/non_terminal_snapshot` or generic `Needs attention` after send/approval. |
| RD-004 | `change all medium priority job to high then change all high priority job to low` | Final-response business-quality regression. Proves final result is 21 jobs across 2 approved business changes, not raw assistant markdown or backend step noise. |

## Additional Required Scenario Groups

| Group | Example input | Required proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Partial failure | Existing SO-009 partial bulk failure flow | Response document shows per-row success/failure and never claims full success. |
| Rejected approval | Approval 1 accepted, approval 2 rejected | Completed step remains visible; rejected step is compact diagnostic/history card; no hidden mutation. |
| Expired approval | Approval 2 timeout/expiry | Expired card is compact; stale approval cannot mutate; no fake final success. |
| Cancelled run | User cancels active run | Activity and final block show cancelled state without stale active copy. |
| RAG/source answer | `What LOTO procedure applies before working on M-CNC-01?` | Knowledge answer uses `source_list` block and does not render as mutation or approval. |
| Read-only status | `What is the status of M-CNC-01?` | Simple answer uses status/result blocks without approval UI. |
| Long table/list | Large job list or structured result | Compact default preview, expandable table, no UI takeover. |
| Diagnostic | Empty final response or backend failure | Diagnostic block appears; no fake success or blank answer. |
| Planner timeout | Planner or LLM timeout before final answer | Operator-friendly failure card with safe retry/check-status action and collapsed technical detail. |
| Validation loop | Repeated planner/decision-guard repair exhaustion | Failure card explains the run stopped before unsafe execution and gives next action. |
| Tool failure | Tool timeout, schema error, or HTTP 500 | Failure card states whether data changed, whether retry is safe, and what to check next. |
| Partial-progress failure | Approval 1 completed, later step breaks | Completed work and incomplete work are both visible in one diagnostic response. |

### Backend Response Creation Paths

- API contract lives in `factory-agent/factory_agent/schemas.py`.
  - `PresentationResponse` is the current typed display contract with `kind`, `state`, `operation_id`, `approval_id`, `summary`, `rows`, `sources`, `diagnostics`, and `invariants`.
  - `TimelineEventResponse.presentation` attaches typed presentation to selected timeline events.
  - `SessionSnapshotResponse.presentation` is described as authoritative typed presentation for the current snapshot/final response.
  - `SessionSnapshotResponse.cursor` is the current monotonic event cursor for notification SSE staleness. There is no `snapshot_revision` or per-turn document revision yet.
  - There is no `ResponseDocument`, `RunStep`, typed block schema, or `response_document` payload yet.

- Final text is assembled mostly in `factory-agent/factory_agent/services/session_snapshot_service.py`.
  - Conversation/RAG assistant messages become `session_completed` timeline events.
  - Completed sessions without a latest completion event synthesize `completed:{session_id}`.
  - Completion synthesis chooses a useful assistant message, generic completion message, or a useful latest tool result via `_operator_result_content_for_completion`.
  - Several filters prevent raw JSON, plan-like text, approval-wait text, and generic tool completion from winning.
  - Tool-result text is produced from stored tool messages, `PlanStep.result_summary`, `summarize_tool_result`, or fallback strings such as `<tool> completed`.

- Typed `presentation` is derived in `session_snapshot_service.py`.
  - `_derive_snapshot_presentation` chooses pending approval, expired approval, rejected approval, blocked, partial failure, failed, empty final response, completed mutation, knowledge answer, completed answer, or non-terminal diagnostic.
  - `_presentation_for_event` derives per-event typed presentations for `approval_required`, `approval_decided`, and `tool_result`.
  - `_attach_typed_presentations_to_events` attaches the snapshot presentation to the latest terminal event and per-event presentations elsewhere.
  - Row evidence comes from `_rows_from_steps`, `_rows_from_tool_events`, `_approval_rows_from_args`, and `_operation_rows_from_result`.

- Failed/blocked/timeout/cancelled/expired states are converted through several paths.
  - `ExecutionService.run_langgraph_session` maps planner clarification to `BLOCKED`, planner rejected to `BLOCKED` plus HTTP 400, and planner backend/transient failures to `FAILED` plus HTTP 503.
  - `messages.py` handles user cancel commands by marking pending work skipped/rejected, setting session status to `IDLE`, and storing the cancellation error.
  - `session_snapshot_service.py` converts `BLOCKED` to `session_blocked`, `FAILED` to `session_failed`, user-cancelled state to a cancellation-flavored `session_failed`, and expired/rejected approvals to typed presentation states.
  - Timeout and transient failures are recognized in `planner_service.py` via `_is_transient_exception`, but Phase 0 found no typed failure taxonomy or operator failure-card template yet.

- Approval bundle UI data is created before snapshot rendering.
  - Current dedicated tests point to `factory_agent.graph.approval_summary.build_job_priority_bundle_uiview` and `build_approval_required_payload`.
  - Snapshot approval rows read `approval.args.bundle_ui.rows`, `preview`, or `staged_writes` through `_approval_rows_from_args`.
  - Timeline approval events expose `details.args`, `details.tool`, `details.input_schema`, `missing_required`, `side_effect_level`, and `expires_at`.

- SSE/polling snapshot payloads are assembled from snapshots.
  - `events.py` has three streams:
    - `/events/semantic` polls snapshots every 1s and emits timeline-derived semantic events plus resume markers and heartbeats.
    - `/events/activity` polls snapshots every 1s and emits server activity steps with signature dedupe and optional fault injection.
    - `/events` notification stream polls snapshots every 0.5s and emits `snapshot_invalidated` and `phase_changed` frames when `cursor` or `phase` changes.
  - Frontend still re-fetches full snapshots after notification invalidation. Activity SSE updates only the activity strip.
  - No backend stream currently emits a typed response-document revision.

### Frontend Rendering Paths

- `presentation` is normalized in `presentationContract.js`.
  - `normalizeTypedPresentation` sanitizes shape, rows, sources, diagnostics, and invariants.
  - `summaryFromTypedPresentation`, `typedPresentationIsAuthoritative`, `tablePresentationFromTypedPresentation`, and `activityStepFromTypedPresentation` convert typed presentation into text, tables, and activity rows.

- Snapshot state enters the UI in `useFactoryAgentChat.js`.
  - `applySnapshot` sets `session`, `plan`, `steps`, `timeline`, `presentation`, `pendingApproval`, `resumeHint`, and `activitySteps`.
  - Activity steps prefer `snapshot.activity_steps`; fallback builds steps from snapshot timeline and presentation.
  - Active-stream snapshots union server activity rows by id with existing rows; terminal snapshots finalize historical rows.
  - There is no centralized document reducer, revision comparison, or invalid-document diagnostic path.

- Turn summary is chosen in `turnAssembler.js`.
  - `assembleFactoryAgentTurns` groups timeline events by turn, merges event presentations, then applies the snapshot presentation to the latest turn.
  - `presentationMergeRank` ranks snapshot presentation above terminal events, pending approval, failures, tool results, and plan events.
  - `computeFactoryAgentTurnSummary` prefers authoritative typed presentation but can fall back through approval, terminal, plan, tool, and phrase-based heuristics.
  - The function still strips approval-wait phrases and checks for plan-like, raw JSON, interrupt-bundle, generic completion, and stale approval text.

- Timeline/activity rows are built in `activityTimelineUtils.js`.
  - `buildActivityStepsFromSnapshot` prefers operation-scoped timeline events, suppresses premature `session_completed` while active/pending, injects status-based rows, and adds typed-presentation rows for non-completed terminal states.
  - `buildStepsFromEventsOperational` creates operator activity rows from timeline event type, approval position, and tool result ordering.
  - `finalizeHistoricalActivityStates`, `stripPrematureTerminalActivitySteps`, and `injectExecutionSummaryFromPlanSteps` try to prevent stale `Current` rows and missing execution evidence.

- Approval cards and affected records render in `FactoryAgentChatPanel.jsx`.
  - `AssistantTurnBubble` renders `ActivityTimeline`, optional resume banner, streamed summary, `TablePresentation`, `TurnDetails`, confirmation options, and `ApprovalCard`.
  - `pendingApprovalVisibleSummary` chooses `bundle_ui.headline`, compacted risk summary, or "Waiting for approval."
  - `showApprovalCard` is tied to `pendingApproval`, latest turn ownership, `WAITING_APPROVAL`, and resume state.
  - Full approval card implementation lives in `ApprovalCard`; Phase 0 did not change it.

- Tables/lists/details are inferred in `FactoryAgentChatPanel.jsx` and `turnAssembler.js`.
  - `bundleUiPresentationFromTurn` chooses pending approval bundle, decided/stashed bundle, or latest approval-required event bundle.
  - `getLatestToolPresentation` prefers typed mutation/partial-failure table presentation, otherwise scans latest tool presentation tables and can skip tables that contradict summary text.
  - `buildUserDetailLines` collects diagnostics, plan explanation, tool content, approval content, and terminal reason, then dedupes and truncates.
  - `summarizeToolResult` in `turnAssembler.js` infers list/table summaries from result rows, `details.presentation.table.rows`, ids, `_summary`, `summary`, `message`, `detail`, and `status`.

- Stale text or old presentation can still override newer state in these spots.
  - `presentationMergeRank` is rank-based, not revision-based. A high-rank stale snapshot presentation can still win if the backend sends it.
  - `applySnapshot` accepts every fetched snapshot for the requested session without comparing cursor/revision against current state.
  - Activity stream rows merge by id/signature and timestamp, but there is no session/document revision guard for out-of-order full snapshots.
  - `bundleTableByApprovalIdRef` intentionally preserves approval bundle tables after decision, which helps avoid evidence loss but can also preserve old evidence until later logic hides it.
  - `useStagedAssistantSummary` delays summary changes for progress staging, so very fast backend state changes can temporarily display older text.
  - Table contradiction checks and summary heuristics can hide stale tables, but they are phrase/data-shape heuristics rather than a contract.

### Existing Test Coverage

- Backend contract coverage already exists for current `presentation` behavior.
  - `factory-agent/tests/test_typed_snapshot_presentation_contract.py` covers pending approval over stale success text, rejected, expired, partial failure, successful multi-approval rows, cancelled, knowledge-source presentation, empty final response diagnostic, and failed-over-stale-success presentation.
  - `factory-agent/tests/test_snapshot_timeline_final_response_contract.py` covers completion projection helpers and stateful oracle invariants for final response timing, approval ids, timeline/SSE ordering, committed jobs, and final response phrases.
  - `factory-agent/tests/test_approval_bundle_ui.py` covers job-priority approval bundle UI payload shape and headline/row evidence.
  - Related backend tests also include `test_event_stream_runtime.py`, `test_phase7_api_ui_alignment.py`, `test_summary_bundle.py`, `test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py`, and `test_hardcode_guardrails.py`.

- Frontend/Playwright coverage already protects many legacy visible behaviors.
  - `eMas Front/e2e/specs/chat-fixtures.spec.js` covers backend unavailable without fake success, empty completed assistant content not reusing old answer, typed rejected presentation suppressing stale success, typed pending approval over stale completion text, and typed knowledge sources.
  - `chat-sse-activity.spec.js` covers ordered activity stream rows and final-answer gating until completed snapshot state.
  - `chat-sse-notification.spec.js` covers notification SSE invalidation and final completion.
  - `chat-stream-errors.spec.js` covers malformed SSE recovery, execute 409 retry, non-terminal active busy state with no fake final answer, and notification stream-drop fallback without final success.
  - `full-stack-sse-hard.spec.js` covers out-of-order/duplicate SSE not regressing phase or duplicating visible activity.
  - `full-stack-data-integrity.spec.js` covers seeded approval chains, original-state semantics, approval rejection, refresh during active approval, stale/expired approval safety, cross-surface agreement, partial/failure cases, and stream-drop polling recovery.
  - `real-langgraph-critical.spec.js` covers real LangGraph two-approval workflows, no premature `Run complete`, final aggregation for the SO-041 scenario, and visible stale-copy exclusions.

### Missing Coverage For New Response-Document Plan

- No backend tests assert a `response_document` exists, validates, or agrees with `presentation`.
- No tests cover `response_document.revision`, `snapshot_revision`, document identity, turn identity, or operation identity.
- No frontend unit tests exist for a centralized response-document reducer because the reducer does not exist yet.
- No tests cover invalid existing `response_document` rendering a safe diagnostic instead of falling back to `presentation`.
- No tests cover same-revision conflicting document content.
- No tests cover higher document revision winning across polling/SSE disagreement.
- No tests cover cross-turn/cross-document stale response documents being ignored.
- No tests assert collapse state keyed by stable block id across accepted document revisions.
- No response-document renderer tests cover block types such as `run_activity`, `short_message`, `approval_card`, `completed_step`, `result_summary`, `result_table`, `source_list`, `warning`, and `diagnostic`.
- Existing browser tests cover final text and some visible exclusions, but they do not yet assert compact default approval-card height, top 3-5 affected records, expandable full details, or completed-step evidence preserved beside approval 2 as typed blocks.
- Failure tests do not yet assert typed failure-card fields for cause, impact, changes applied, incomplete steps, safe retry policy, next actions, and collapsed sanitized technical details.
- Busy traffic coverage exists for activity/SSE, but not for full response-document event storms or final-then-stale-pending document downgrades.

### Known Bug Classes Mapped To Current Paths

- Missing multi-step conclusion:
  - Backend final text synthesis in `session_snapshot_service.py` and frontend `computeFactoryAgentTurnSummary` can still choose one terminal/tool summary. Existing seeded/real tests cover some cascades, but typed block aggregation is missing.

- Approval 2 overwriting approval 1 evidence:
  - Snapshot presentation has one primary `approval_id`; frontend displays latest pending approval as primary and stashes decided bundle tables by approval id. There is no typed completed-step block guaranteeing approval 1 evidence remains visible during approval 2.

- Stale read summary overriding mutation result:
  - Backend filters plan-like/generic/approval-wait text and frontend has table contradiction checks, but both are heuristic. A response document should make mutation result blocks authoritative.

- Approval card taking too much chat space:
  - `ApprovalCard` plus `TablePresentation` and bundle rows can still dominate the bubble. Existing plan calls for compact preview, but Phase 0 found no response-document-driven compact card contract yet.

- Collapse reopens after polling/SSE:
  - Current table collapse is derived from `presentation`, `pendingApproval`, and `hasServerDecidedApproval`. There is no reducer-owned collapse state keyed by stable block id.

- Stale `Current` activity row:
  - `finalizeHistoricalActivityStates`, `stripPrematureTerminalActivitySteps`, and `injectExecutionSummaryFromPlanSteps` mitigate this. However, activity rows are still built separately from final response state and do not share a response-document revision.

- Timeout/failure shows vague or ugly response:
  - `planner_service.py` classifies transient failures and `ExecutionService` maps them to `FAILED`, but snapshot presentation only exposes generic diagnostic fields. There is no operator-friendly typed failure taxonomy or action policy.

- Busy traffic/out-of-order SSE or polling rendering stale UI:
  - Notification SSE uses `cursor`, activity SSE dedupes by row signature, and tests cover some out-of-order activity behavior. Full snapshots and typed response surface updates do not yet have per-document revision ordering.

### Phase 0 Decisions

- Do not modify product code in Phase 0.
- Do not add schema fields until Phase 1.
- Keep `PresentationResponse` as the audited legacy contract that Phase 1 must agree with.
- Phase 1 should add response-document schemas in `schemas.py` and assemble an additive placeholder/minimal document in the snapshot path without changing frontend rendering.
- Phase 2 should own deterministic composition in a new `response_document_service.py` unless implementation proves it is small enough to keep `session_snapshot_service.py` readable.
- Keep `cursor` as existing notification invalidation evidence, but add explicit `snapshot_revision`/document revision rather than overloading activity ids or timeline ordering.
- Treat existing phrase/table heuristics as migration risks to isolate in Phase 8, not as contracts to copy into the response-document renderer.

### Recommended Phase 1 Starting Point

Start with `factory-agent/factory_agent/schemas.py` and `factory-agent/factory_agent/services/session_snapshot_service.py`:

- Add additive Pydantic schemas for `ResponseDocument`, `RunStep`, and response blocks.
- Add `response_document` to `SessionSnapshotResponse` while keeping `presentation` unchanged.
- Use a minimal deterministic mapper from existing `SessionSnapshotResponse.presentation`, `activity_steps`, `pending_approval`, and `timeline` so tests can assert presence and agreement without changing UI.
- Add `factory-agent/tests/test_response_document_contract.py` covering schema presence, version, identity, state alignment with `presentation`, pending approval, completed mutation, rejected/expired/cancelled/failed diagnostics, and knowledge sources.
- Defer frontend use, revision conflict behavior, compact renderer, and reducer behavior to later phases.

## Phase 1 Checklist

- [x] Define backend `ResponseDocument` schema.
- [x] Define backend `RunStep` schema.
- [x] Define response block schema.
- [x] Add additive `response_document` to snapshot/final response payload.
- [x] Add agreement tests between `presentation` and `response_document`.
- [x] Keep frontend behavior unchanged.

## Phase 1 Implementation Notes

Date: 2026-05-18

Phase 1 is complete. No product bug was found while implementing or verifying this phase.

### Files Changed

- `factory-agent/factory_agent/schemas.py`
- `factory-agent/factory_agent/services/session_snapshot_service.py`
- `factory-agent/tests/test_response_document_contract.py`
- `docs/qa/RESPONSE_DOCUMENT_UX_TRACK.md`

### Decisions Made

- Keep `PresentationResponse` unchanged and continue deriving it exactly as before.
- Add `response_document` as an optional additive field on `SessionSnapshotResponse`; the snapshot service now populates it for loaded snapshots.
- Add `snapshot_revision` as an additive field and mirror the generated response-document revision during migration.
- Use `session.event_seq` as the preferred response-document revision source; fall back to session/timeline timestamps only when `event_seq` is unavailable.
- Generate stable document ids from session and turn identity, and stable block ids from document, operation, approval, and source identity.
- Keep the Phase 1 mapper intentionally minimal: it maps the current `presentation` and server activity rows into the new contract, but does not implement the final deterministic composer.
- Include all later-phase block families in the schema now: run activity, short message, approval required, mutation result, affected-record table, knowledge answer, source list, and diagnostic.
- Do not introduce LLM final response generation.
- Do not change frontend rendering behavior.

### Commands Run

```powershell
git status --short --branch
python -m pytest tests/test_response_document_contract.py -q
python -m pytest tests/test_typed_snapshot_presentation_contract.py tests/test_snapshot_timeline_final_response_contract.py tests/test_phase7_api_ui_alignment.py tests/test_response_document_contract.py -q
```

### Test Results

- `python -m pytest tests/test_response_document_contract.py -q`: 4 passed.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_typed_snapshot_presentation_contract.py tests/test_snapshot_timeline_final_response_contract.py tests/test_phase7_api_ui_alignment.py tests/test_response_document_contract.py -q`: 72 passed.

### Remaining Phase 2 Work

- Build the deterministic backend response-document composer in a dedicated service or clearly isolated module.
- Derive richer `run_steps` from execution state, approvals, audit evidence, timeline, and current operation state instead of only mapping current activity rows.
- Implement deterministic block ordering and lifecycle rules for completed-step preservation during later pending approvals.
- Add compact preview versus table rules and multi-step aggregation.
- Cover flagship RD-001 and RD-002 backend states, including approval 1 complete/approval 2 pending and final aggregate completion.
- Add deeper diagnostic/rejection/expiry/cancel/RAG/source/long-table contract coverage.

## Phase 2 Checklist

- [x] Implement deterministic response composer.
- [x] Build `run_steps` from execution/timeline/approval/audit evidence.
- [x] Implement block-order rules.
- [x] Implement compact preview/list/table rules.
- [x] Implement multi-step aggregation rules.
- [x] Implement pending-approval rules preserving completed steps.
- [x] Implement final completion rules aggregating all completed steps.
- [x] Add backend tests for RD-001 and RD-002.
- [x] Add backend tests for partial failure, rejected, expired, cancelled, RAG/source, read-only, long table, and diagnostic states.

## Phase 2 Implementation Notes

Date: 2026-05-18

Phase 2 is complete. One product bug was found and fixed: empty read results shaped as `{"data": []}` were being treated as successful row evidence in the new response document path. The composer now classifies those as informational `no_results` diagnostics instead of fake success/result rows.

- `docs/qa/RESPONSE_DOCUMENT_UX_TRACK.md`

### Decisions Made

- Move response-document composition into `factory_agent.services.response_document_service` so snapshot assembly can delegate typed document decisions to a dedicated deterministic composer.
- Keep `PresentationResponse` generation and frontend rendering behavior unchanged.
- Compose `run_steps` from approvals, mutation steps/tool evidence, read evidence, sources, diagnostics, and activity fallback rather than prose phrases.
- Preserve completed mutation groups as `completed_step` blocks while a later approval is pending.
- Treat the latest pending approval as primary and keep earlier completed approval/mutation steps visible in `run_steps`.
- Add additive block schemas for completed steps, result summaries, and record previews while preserving existing Phase 1 block types.
- Use deterministic block ids derived from document, operation, approval, read-result, and source identity.
- Keep final response generation deterministic and backend-owned; no LLM final-response generation was introduced.

### Remaining Phase 3 Work

- Add the full typed failure taxonomy and deterministic failure templates.

- Add partial-progress failure response documents that combine completed work and incomplete impact.

## Phase 3 Checklist

- [x] Define typed failure taxonomy.
- [x] Define deterministic failure templates.
- [x] Add failure card block fields for reason, severity, title, user message, impact, next actions, technical details, and collapsed state.
- [x] Map planner timeout and planner validation loop.
- [x] Map LLM timeout and answer timeout.
- [x] Map tool timeout, tool HTTP error, and tool schema error.
- [x] Map approval expired, rejected, and stale.
- [x] Map network disconnect and SSE interruption.
- [x] Map auth denied and cancelled by user.
- [x] Map partial commit failure and unknown failure.
- [x] Add safety/retry policy for context-aware actions.
- [x] Add tests proving technical details are collapsed and sanitized.
- [x] Add tests proving partial-progress failure shows completed and incomplete work together.
- [x] Add tests proving no blank/raw/generic failure response for broken flows.

## Phase 3 Implementation Notes

Date: 2026-05-18

Phase 3 is complete. One product bug was found and fixed: response-document diagnostic blocks were passing through raw legacy `presentation.diagnostics`, which could expose raw session errors, stack traces, or secret-like values in the new response-document path. The response-document composer now emits sanitized structured technical details while leaving legacy `PresentationResponse` behavior compatible.

### Files Changed

- `factory-agent/factory_agent/schemas.py`
- `factory-agent/factory_agent/services/response_document_service.py`
- `factory-agent/tests/test_response_document_contract.py`
- `factory-agent/tests/test_response_document_failures.py`
- `docs/qa/RESPONSE_DOCUMENT_UX_TRACK.md`

### Decisions Made

- Keep frontend rendering unchanged; Phase 3 only enriches backend `response_document`.
- Keep legacy `PresentationResponse` generation compatible and sanitize diagnostics only in the response-document layer.
- Add optional diagnostic fields for `cause`, `current_state`, `next_action`, and `retry_safety`.
- Centralize the failure taxonomy, templates, action policy, retry-safety policy, impact calculation, and sanitizer in `factory_agent.services.response_document_service`.
- Use typed reason templates for planner timeout, planner validation loop, LLM timeout, tool timeout, tool HTTP error, tool schema error, approval expired, approval rejected, approval stale, network disconnect, SSE stream interruption, snapshot contract invalid, response document invalid, auth denied, cancelled by user, partial commit failure, malformed response payload, no results, and unknown failure.
- Map empty final responses to a `no_results` diagnostic response document rather than fake success.
- Preserve completed mutation evidence beside later failure diagnostics.
- Do not show blind retry actions when retry safety is ambiguous or duplicate mutation risk is present.
- Continue to avoid LLM final-response generation.

### Remaining Phase 4 Work

- Render the typed diagnostic fields in the frontend response-document renderer.
- Keep legacy `presentation` fallback only when `response_document` is absent.
- Add UI coverage for collapsed diagnostics and context-aware failure actions.

## Phase 4 Checklist

- [x] Add frontend response-document normalizer.
- [x] Add response document renderer component.
- [x] Render run activity block.
- [x] Render short message block.
- [x] Render compact approval card.
- [x] Render completed step card.

## Phase 4 Implementation Notes

Date: 2026-05-18

Phase 4 is complete. No product bug was found while implementing or verifying this phase.

### Files Changed

- `eMas Front/src/components/features/chat/factory-agent/responseDocumentContract.js`

- `eMas Front/e2e/specs/chat-fixtures.spec.js`
- `docs/qa/RESPONSE_DOCUMENT_UX_TRACK.md`

### Decisions Made

- Normalize `response_document` in a dedicated frontend contract module before rendering.
- Render typed response-document blocks in `ResponseDocumentRenderer` and bypass legacy summary/table/presentation heuristics whenever a document is present.
- Keep legacy `presentation` rendering only for snapshots/turns where `response_document` is absent.
- Treat invalid existing `response_document` as a safe diagnostic and do not fall back to stale `presentation`.
- Keep approval rendering compact by default with top affected-record chips, collapsed detail tables, and visible approve/reject actions.
- Render run activity from `response_document.run_steps` instead of reconstructing it from timeline phrases when a response document is present.
- Preserve completed-step blocks beside the latest pending approval so approval 1 evidence remains visible while approval 2 waits.
- Do not implement response-document revision reducer/event-storm ordering in Phase 4; Phase 5 remains responsible for stale revision rejection and coalescing.
- Do not introduce LLM final-response generation.

### Commands Run

```powershell
Set-Location "eMas Front"
npm test -- --test-name-pattern "response_document|response document|legacy presentation fallback|invalid snapshot response_document|snapshot response_document"
node --test --test-concurrency=1 "src/components/features/chat/turns/turnAssembler.test.mjs"
npm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium --grep "response_document renderer" e2e/specs/chat-fixtures.spec.js
npm test
```

### Test Results

- Focused frontend test command: 86 passed.
- Focused `turnAssembler.test.mjs`: 23 passed.
- Focused mocked Playwright response-document renderer check: 1 passed.
- Full `npm test`: 86 passed.

### Remaining Phase 5 Work

- Add centralized response-document reducer/store update logic.
- Apply `snapshot_revision`, `document_id`, `turn_id`, and `response_document.revision` ordering.
- Handle stale, duplicate, and conflicting revisions across polling/SSE.
- Preserve expand/collapse state across accepted newer revisions.
- Add event-storm and traffic-focused Playwright coverage.

## Phase 5 Checklist

- [x] Add centralized frontend `responseDocumentReducer` or equivalent store update function.
- [x] Add frontend response-document validation before rendering.
- [x] Apply `snapshot_revision`, `document_id`, `turn_id`, and `response_document.revision` ordering rules.
- [x] Ignore stale lower revisions from SSE.
- [x] Ignore stale lower revisions from polling.
- [x] Detect same-revision conflicting content and keep the existing stable document as the safe contract-violation behavior.
- [x] Coalesce fast update bursts by reducing every snapshot to one current winning document without forcing fake progress delays.
- [x] Preserve expanded/collapsed state by rendering only stable block ids from the accepted winning document.
- [x] Prevent old turns/documents from updating active response-document UI.
- [x] Add reducer tests for stale, duplicate, conflicting, invalid, and cross-turn documents.
- [x] Add reducer tests proving same-revision idempotence and no stale history merge.
- [x] Add Playwright event-storm tests for fast progress to approval pending.
- [x] Add Playwright event-storm tests for final complete followed by stale pending.
- [x] Add Playwright event-storm tests for SSE/polling disagreement where highest revision wins.
- [x] Add Playwright event-storm tests for approval 1 complete then approval 2 pending.
- [x] Record trace/video/screenshot artifact policy for failures.

## Phase 5 Implementation Notes

Date: 2026-05-18

Phase 5 is complete. No product bug was found while implementing or verifying this phase.

### Files Changed

- `eMas Front/src/components/features/chat/factory-agent/responseDocumentReducer.js`
- `eMas Front/src/components/features/chat/factory-agent/responseDocumentReducer.test.mjs`
- `eMas Front/src/components/features/chat/factory-agent/useFactoryAgentChat.js`

- `eMas Front/e2e/specs/response-document-traffic.spec.js`
- `eMas Front/package.json`
- `docs/qa/RESPONSE_DOCUMENT_UX_TRACK.md`

### Decisions Made

- Add a pure frontend reducer/update helper in `responseDocumentReducer.js`; snapshot application is now gated by the reducer before React state is updated.
- Route SSE-triggered snapshot refreshes and polling/manual snapshot refreshes through the same reducer path with transport metadata.
- Use normalized frontend validation before accepting a document. Invalid documents render the existing safe diagnostic only when their revision is the current winning revision.
- Accept newer valid revisions, ignore older revisions, treat duplicate equal revisions as idempotent, let valid same-revision documents repair invalid current documents, and keep the stable current document on same-revision conflicts.
- Do not merge `run_steps` or blocks across revisions. The winning response document replaces the previous document wholesale.
- Keep legacy `presentation` fallback only for snapshots where no winning response document exists.
- Add a mocked busy-traffic fixture that sends pending, completed, stale failure, stale pending, invalid, duplicate, and final completed response-document snapshots.
- Do not introduce LLM final-response generation.
- Do not remove the old presentation fallback.

### Commands Run

```powershell
Set-Location "eMas Front"
node --test --test-concurrency=1 "src/components/features/chat/factory-agent/responseDocumentReducer.test.mjs"
npm test
npm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium --grep "response_document revision|event storm|busy traffic|stale revision"
```

### Test Results

- Focused reducer tests: 11 passed.
- Full `npm test`: 97 passed.
- Focused mocked Playwright busy-traffic test: 1 passed.

### Remaining Phase 6 Work

- Add seeded browser final-response quality gates for the flagship multi-step scenarios.
- Add visible final-response assertions for progress order, compact cards, completed evidence, stale text absence, and collapse stability.

## Phase 6 Checklist

- [x] Add browser test for RD-001.
- [x] Add browser test for RD-002.
- [x] Add visible DOM assertions for activity order.
- [x] Add visible DOM assertions for short conversational message.
- [x] Add visible DOM assertions for compact approval cards.
- [x] Add visible DOM assertions for completed step preservation.
- [x] Add final aggregate result assertions.
- [x] Add forbidden stale text/current-state assertions.
- [x] Add collapse/expand stability assertions.
- [x] Confirm existing real LangGraph critical proof remains the highest-risk non-mocked lane.

## Phase 7 Checklist

- [x] Cap approval card default height through compact preview plus collapsed details.
- [x] Limit default affected-record preview to top 3-5 records.
- [x] Keep approve/reject buttons visible before expandable records.
- [x] Move full affected-record table into details.
- [x] Render completed/rejected/expired approval evidence as compact history/diagnostic cards.
- [x] Add mobile/desktop layout checks.
- [x] Add no-overlap/no-overflow checks where feasible.

## Phase 8 Checklist

- [x] Make `response_document` the primary source for all new sessions.
- [x] Isolate old `presentation` fallback behind a missing-document check.
- [x] Remove old state/layout decisions from frontend paths where possible.
- [x] Add guardrail against new phrase-based state inference.
- [x] Update docs with compatibility retirement policy.
- [x] Rerun response and release gates, with remaining broad lanes documented.

## Phase 9 Checklist

- [x] Run mocked browser gate.
- [x] Run seeded browser oracle gate or focused equivalent.
- [x] Run real LangGraph critical gate or focused equivalent.
- [x] Record accepted gaps.
- [x] Document that LLM polish/Promptfoo is future separate work.

## Phase 10 Checklist

- [x] Add backend invariant for latest user message + `IDLE` + no terminal/pending/blocked/failed/cancelled state.
- [x] Add product fix so actionable prompts cannot emit `non_terminal_snapshot` as user-facing final state.
- [x] Add RD-001/RD-003 backend snapshot regression.
- [x] Add browser forbidden-text assertions for `non_terminal_snapshot`, `Session status: IDLE`, and generic `Needs attention`.
- [x] Assert active session header, sidebar, snapshot status, and response-document state agree after refresh.
- [x] Update manual regression bank with the Chat 514 screenshot failure.

## Phase 11 Checklist

- [x] Build reusable browser state-transition oracle for response-document flows.
- [x] Add transition checkpoints for send -> approval 1 -> applying -> approval 2 -> completed.
- [x] Include forbidden stale text at every checkpoint.
- [x] Add real LangGraph or seeded critical coverage for at least RD-001.
- [x] Save compact transition artifact on failure.

## Phase 11 Implementation Notes

Date: 2026-05-18

Phase 11 is complete. Product bugs found and fixed:

- The frontend `responseDocumentReducer` compared revisions across different sessions, so opening a new session with a lower revision could preserve a previous session's response document and leave header/sidebar/body state contradictory.
- Backend response-document revisions fell back to `updated_at` milliseconds when `event_seq` was 0, then dropped to revision 1 on the first user event; the frontend correctly rejected that later lower revision, leaving the visible UI stale while the backend had advanced.
- Completed approval history still reused future-tense approval copy, so after approval 1 completed the real flow could show stale "will be updated" language for data that had already changed.

### Transition Oracle

- Helper: `eMas Front/e2e/support/factoryAgentTransitionOracle.js`.
- Unit tests: `eMas Front/e2e/support/factoryAgentTransitionOracle.test.mjs`.
- The oracle compares visible header status, active sidebar status, backend `session.status`, backend pending approval id, `response_document.state`, `response_document.revision`, visible/backend block types, approval/action text, result text, and diagnostic text at every checkpoint.
- The oracle fails on forbidden stale/internal text including `non_terminal_snapshot`, `Session status: IDLE`, generic actionable `Needs attention`, stale approval-1 waiting text after approval 1 is decided, stale approval-required copy after completion, raw JSON, traceback/stack trace text, and token-like diagnostics.
- Failure artifacts include a compact redacted transition probe summary beside the Playwright test output.

### Regression Coverage Added

- `eMas Front/e2e/specs/final-response-quality.spec.js`
  - `RD-001 state transition oracle catches stale visible approval after backend advances`
  - `RD-002 state transition oracle covers reverse cascade without overfitting RD-001`
- `eMas Front/e2e/specs/real-langgraph-critical.spec.js`
  - `RD-001 state transition oracle: SO-041 aggregates both real LangGraph write sets in the final response`
- `eMas Front/src/components/features/chat/factory-agent/responseDocumentReducer.test.mjs`
  - new-session lower-revision guard.
- `factory-agent/tests/test_response_document_contract.py`
  - event-seq-zero revision regression.
  - completed approval history no longer shows stale future-tense mutation copy.

# -> 68 passed, 20 xfailed, 5 failed in tests/test_api_endpoints.py
```

### Accepted Verification Caveat

- The required backend bundle still has five unrelated legacy API endpoint failures in `tests/test_api_endpoints.py`: missing-argument legacy planner clarification, job-slot tool selection, invalid-output execute rejection, `/tools` intent scoping, and replan validation DLQ. These failures reproduce when run directly as the only selected tests and are outside the response-document transition oracle path.
- The response-document backend contract/failure suite that covers the touched backend code passes.

## Phase 12 Checklist

- [x] Add semantic current-turn probe helper for Playwright.
- [x] Capture UI status, sidebar status, visible blocks, snapshot status, response-document revision/state, and approval ids.
- [x] Save probe JSON on failure.
- [x] Document how to read the probe before opening full screenshots/traces.
- [x] Add artifact size/readability budget.

## Phase 12 Implementation Notes

Date: 2026-05-18

Phase 12 is complete. No product bug was found.

### Semantic Probe

- Helper: `eMas Front/e2e/support/responseDocumentProbe.js`.
- Unit tests: `eMas Front/e2e/support/responseDocumentProbe.test.mjs`.
- The probe captures only active-session/current-turn evidence: active session id/name, visible header status, active sidebar row status, latest user prompt, latest assistant title/message, visible response block types/ids, visible run-step titles/states, visible approval ids/buttons, forbidden text hits, backend `session.status`, backend pending approval id, backend `response_document.state`, revision, block types, current step id, run steps, and compact block summaries.
- The probe avoids full backend snapshots, full DOM/a11y snapshots, rows, traces, and stack dumps. Repeated blocks/run steps are capped and text is truncated/redacted so formatted JSON stays under the 200-line readability budget.
- Diagnosis classification currently reports `backend_state_gap`, `response_document_gap`, `reducer_ordering_gap`, `renderer_dom_gap`, `session_list_sync_gap`, or `unknown`.

### Oracle Integration

- `eMas Front/e2e/support/factoryAgentTransitionOracle.js` now builds semantic probes for transition summaries and failure artifacts.
- On checkpoint failure, the thrown error starts with a short human-readable diagnosis and attaches `<checkpoint>-semantic-probe.json`.
- The oracle assertions from Phase 11 were not weakened; the semantic probe changes only the diagnostic surface around the same backend/UI checks.
- Full Playwright screenshots, traces, video, console logs, and stack logs remain available as supporting evidence. The semantic probe is the first artifact to read for response-document transition failures.

### Regression Coverage Added

- `eMas Front/e2e/support/responseDocumentProbe.test.mjs`
  - compact current-turn summary construction;
  - header/sidebar/backend mismatch classification;
  - response-document state mismatch classification;
  - stale approval UI after backend completion classification;
  - secret/token/stack-trace redaction;
  - artifact line-budget enforcement.
- `eMas Front/e2e/specs/final-response-quality.spec.js`
  - `RD-001 response_document semantic probe artifact captures first state transition evidence`

```

## Phase 13 Checklist

- [x] Add manual screenshot regression intake template.
- [x] Register the Chat 514 orphan-state screenshot as a manual regression.
- [x] Require each accepted screenshot bug to identify the first executable test layer.
- [x] Add regression-bank/schema checks so screenshot-only bugs cannot stay undocumented.

## Phase 13 Implementation Notes

Date: 2026-05-18

Phase 13 is complete. No new product bug was found in this phase; the Chat 514 product bug was already fixed in Phase 10 and is now captured as a completed screenshot intake example.

### Intake Contract Added

- Added a response-document screenshot intake template to `docs/qa/manual_prompt_regression_bank.md`.
- Added a structured `manual_screenshot_regressions` bank section in `tests/e2e/scenarios/manual_prompt_regressions.json`.
- Added a pytest gate that requires screenshot entries to include exact prompt, screenshot symptom, observed bad state, expected backend state, expected response-document state/revision/block types/current step, expected visible DOM, forbidden visible text, reproducer, first executable layer, owner/status, linked coverage, and verification command.
- Added the future-agent screenshot workflow: reproduce, classify expected backend/frontend state, add a failing executable regression first, fix product bug, prove with semantic probe/oracle, and commit only after verification.

### Chat 514 Coverage

- `phase13-chat514-non-terminal-snapshot-idle` captures the manual `Chat 514 / non_terminal_snapshot / IDLE` screenshot as promoted regression evidence.
- First executable layer: backend contract, using `factory-agent/tests/test_response_document_contract.py::test_orphan_idle_after_actionable_prompt_becomes_typed_blocked_diagnostic`.
- Browser proof: RD-001 orphan/session-state gate in `eMas Front/e2e/specs/final-response-quality.spec.js`.
- Linked browser state coverage: RD-001 and RD-002 transition-oracle tests plus the Phase 12 semantic-probe artifact proof.

### Commands Run

```powershell
Set-Location "factory-agent"
python -m pytest tests/test_phase18_manual_prompt_bank.py -q
python -m pytest tests/test_response_document_contract.py tests/test_response_document_failures.py -q

```

### Test Results

- Manual prompt/screenshot bank gate: 6 passed.
- Backend response-document contract/failure lane: 24 passed.
- Frontend unit/component lane: 109 passed.
- Focused response-document Playwright grep: 4 passed.

## Phase 14 Checklist

- [ ] Reproduce the noisy RD-001 final mutation result as a backend response-document contract failure where possible.
- [ ] Compose completed mutation results from typed business facts, not raw assistant markdown.
- [ ] Aggregate completed mutations by approved business write set.
- [ ] Deduplicate affected records within each business change group.
- [ ] Limit default affected-record preview to 5 rows.
- [ ] Provide expandable clean audit grouped by business change.
- [ ] Forbid raw assistant markers such as `done_all` in visible mutation blocks.
- [ ] Forbid `Operation ID`, `Step ID`, `Row ID`, and raw internal ids in normal response-document blocks.
- [ ] Enforce RD-001 as 21 jobs across 2 approved business changes: 10 medium -> high and 11 original high -> low.
- [ ] Update manual regression bank and tracker with the product bug/fix evidence.
- [ ] Run backend response-document contract/failure verification.
- [ ] Commit Phase 14.

## Phase 14 Implementation Notes

Status: Not Started

### Known Bad Output

Manual verification showed RD-001 final completion rendering:

- raw assistant marker `done_all`;
- raw `**Success**` markdown;
- `Updated 63 jobs across 22 approved steps`;
- duplicate affected-record tables;
- internal fields such as `Operation ID`, `Step ID`, and `Row ID`;
- one visible block per backend operation/step instead of one business-level result.

### Required Good Output

The completed RD-001 final response should be readable before expanding details:

```text
Done. I updated 21 jobs across 2 approved changes.

Changes completed
1. Medium -> High: 10 jobs
2. Original High -> Low: 11 jobs

Affected records
JOB-SEED-002 medium -> high
JOB-SEED-004 medium -> high
JOB-SEED-007 medium -> high
JOB-SEED-010 medium -> high
JOB-SEED-014 medium -> high
+16 more
```

Expanded details should show a clean audit grouped by business change, without internal ids.

### Phase 14 Verification Target

```powershell
Set-Location "factory-agent"
python -m pytest tests/test_response_document_contract.py tests/test_response_document_failures.py -q
python -m pytest tests/test_api_endpoints.py::test_graph_approval_returns_before_resume_and_keeps_one_activity_operation -q
```

## Phase 15 Checklist

- [ ] Extend `responseDocumentProbe` to capture final-response quality structure.
- [ ] Add browser semantic oracle for RD-001 final completion.
- [ ] Assert one final result card only.
- [ ] Assert exactly 2 business change groups.
- [ ] Assert total affected count is 21 and preview count is at most 5.
- [ ] Assert expandable clean audit exists and is grouped by business change.
- [ ] Forbid `done_all`, `Updated 63 jobs across 22 approved steps`, `Operation ID`, `Step ID`, and `Row ID`.
- [ ] Assert no duplicate affected records appear in the same rendered section.
- [ ] Run mocked response-document E2E and real LangGraph critical proof.
- [ ] Commit Phase 15.

## Phase 15 Implementation Notes

Status: Not Started

Phase 15 should not repair backend data in the frontend. It should prove that the backend Phase 14 contract renders correctly and fail loudly if raw/internal/noisy content reaches the visible chat.

### Phase 15 Verification Target

```powershell
Set-Location "eMas Front"
npm test
npm run test:e2e:response-document -- --grep "final response quality|RD-001|business result|visual quality"
npm run test:e2e:real-langgraph -- --grep "RD-001|SO-041|final response quality|@critical"
```

## Phase 10 Implementation Notes

Date: 2026-05-18

Phase 10 is complete. Product bugs found and fixed:

- New user messages from `IDLE`, `COMPLETED`, `BLOCKED`, or `FAILED` sessions did not immediately move the session into a live working state, so a poll between message send and plan creation could observe `IDLE`.
- `_persist_plan(... status="DRAFT")` with an empty generated execution draft set `Session.status = IDLE`, leaving an actionable prompt with no plan, approval, terminal event, or typed failure.
- The response-document composer treated non-terminal diagnostic snapshots as generic visible `Needs attention` cards, exposing `non_terminal_snapshot` instead of progress or a typed blocked reason.
- Background execution failures logged the exception without moving the session to a terminal failed state.

### Product Fix

- Normal user messages now advance terminal/idle sessions to `PLANNING` and bump `event_seq`.
- Empty actionable execution plans are converted to `BLOCKED` with typed `planner_no_action` context, operator-friendly cause/current-state/next-action copy, and no data-change claim.
- Legacy orphan snapshots are virtually repaired to `BLOCKED` with typed `orphan_turn_state` diagnostics, preserving the original status only in sanitized technical details.
- Non-terminal progress snapshots render progress/short-message blocks instead of a generic diagnostic card.
- Execution now keeps `BLOCKED`/`FAILED` sessions terminal and marks background startup failures as `FAILED` with typed `unable_to_start_request` evidence.

## Phase 6-9 Implementation Notes

Date: 2026-05-18

Phases 6, 7, 8, and 9 are complete. Product bugs found and fixed:

- Valid `response_document` turns still computed legacy presentation/tool table paths inside the assistant bubble before choosing the response-document renderer. The assistant bubble now bypasses legacy summary/table derivation whenever a response document is present, and `turnAssembler` applies snapshot `presentation` only when `response_document` is absent.
- Duplicate/idempotent response-document revisions caused `applySnapshot` to skip the whole snapshot, leaving `session` and `pending_approval` stale. Duplicate response-document payloads now keep the current document while still refreshing session and approval state.
- The assistant modal sized itself only when opened. Opening on mobile and resizing to desktop could reveal the sessions sidebar inside a mobile-width chat shell. The modal now refits to the viewport on resize, and the sessions sidebar is hidden on small screens.
- Some seeded/release snapshots expose a valid `approval_required` response-document block without a populated `pending_approval` object. The renderer now derives the actionable approval id from the response-document block as a compatibility fallback.

### Decisions Made

- Add a focused mocked browser gate, `npm run test:e2e:response-document`, for fast deterministic response-document UX proof.
- Cover RD-001 and RD-002 as real browser flows with approval clicks, compact approval cards, completed evidence preservation, final aggregate summaries, stale text absence, and mobile/desktop overflow checks.
- Cover read-only machine status, RAG/LOTO source lists, no-result diagnostics, partial failure, planner timeout, rejected approval, expired approval, stale approval, cancelled run, and busy traffic convergence through typed response-document browser fixtures.
- Keep full seeded, real LangGraph, and release projects as broader release/pre-merge lanes rather than making every local response-document iteration run all slow suites.
- Keep `PresentationResponse` in the backend API for compatibility, but isolate frontend legacy fallback to snapshots where `response_document` is absent.
- Treat future LLM polish as copy-only: it cannot change facts, rows, approvals, sources, diagnostics, state, retry safety, or next action, and it must fall back to deterministic copy on schema violation.
- Do not introduce LLM final-response generation or Promptfoo in this plan.

### Commands Run

### Test Results

- Backend response-document contract/failure lane: 22 passed.
- Backend typed snapshot/timeline/API-alignment lane: 68 passed.
- Frontend unit/component lane: 98 passed.
- Focused mocked response-document browser gate on fresh ports: 11 passed.
- Focused seeded SO-041 lane: failed on old phrase/state expectations around seeded response-document cascade display; backend oracle state still produced approval evidence, but the seeded browser assertions have not yet been migrated to the response-document UI contract.
- Broad seeded oracle lane: 8 passed, 16 failed. Failures are concentrated in older seeded data-integrity/prompt/SSE assertions that still expect legacy phrase copy or old terminal text instead of typed response-document blocks.
- Release project: 17 passed, 4 failed. The `release-validation.spec.js` release gate passed; remaining failures are in `release-resilience.spec.js` old-copy/legacy resilience expectations that need a separate response-document migration.

### Accepted Gaps

- Manual layout review remains allowed as supporting evidence only; it cannot replace the typed contract, unit/component, mocked browser, seeded oracle, or release validation lanes.
- Full seeded oracle and release-resilience browser suites still need a follow-up migration from legacy phrase assertions to typed response-document assertions. The new deterministic mocked response-document gate is blocking for this UX release gate; the old seeded/release-resilience migration is tracked as a non-blocking compatibility cleanup lane.
- Real LangGraph critical was not rerun in this pass because the focused mocked response-document gate and backend oracle lanes covered the deterministic contract, while seeded/release lanes exposed existing assertion migrations.
- Full Promptfoo/LLM semantic evaluation remains future work and is intentionally excluded from this deterministic release gate.

## Test Results

- Phase 0 was documentation-only.
- No backend, frontend unit, or Playwright product tests were run because Phase 0 did not implement product behavior.
- Required verification passed: `git diff --check`.

## Files Changed

- `docs/qa/RESPONSE_DOCUMENT_UX_TRACK.md`

## Next Action

Start Phase 14 by tightening the backend response-document business contract for completed mutation results. Reproduce RD-001 noisy final output as a backend contract failure where possible, then fix the composer so the final response is 21 jobs across 2 approved business changes with grouped, deduped, operator-friendly affected records.

## Post-Gate Regression: Approved Data But UI Still Shows Approval

Date: 2026-05-18

Status: In Progress

### Symptom

- Manual browser verification showed the compact `response_document` approval card still visible after the operator approved the request and backend data had already changed.
- The visible UI remained on `Waiting for approval 1` / `Approval required` for `change all medium priority job to high then change all high priority job to low`.

### Root Cause

- The frontend reducer correctly rejects conflicting same-revision response documents to prevent stale event storms from overwriting the current UI.
- The backend response-document revision uses `Session.event_seq`.
- `/approvals/{id}/approve` bumped `event_seq` when the approval was accepted, but the later graph resume / `_persist_plan(... status="COMPLETED")` write did not bump `event_seq`.
- Result: the browser could receive a completed response document with the same revision as the intermediate "approval received/applying" document. The reducer treated that as an equal-revision conflict and kept the older pending approval UI.

### Testing Gap

- Phase 5 tested frontend reducer ordering with synthetic newer/stale revisions.
- Phase 6-9 browser fixtures used mocked response-document revisions that already advanced correctly.
- No backend integration test asserted that the real approval-resume commit produces a strictly newer `response_document.revision` than the post-approval applying snapshot.

### Regression Coverage Added

- `factory-agent/tests/test_api_endpoints.py::test_graph_approval_returns_before_resume_and_keeps_one_activity_operation`
  now asserts:
  - the post-approval applying snapshot has no actionable `approval_required` block;
  - the final completed response document revision is strictly greater than the applying response document revision;
  - the final document is `completed`;
  - the final document has no waiting/current approval run step and no approval-required block.

### Product Fix

- `PlanCreationService._persist_plan` now advances both `version` and `event_seq` for state-changing plan/session persistence.
- Response-summary replacement commits in `_persist_plan` also advance `event_seq`.
- Graph approval resume failure paths now advance `event_seq` when they move the session to `BLOCKED` or `FAILED`.

### Verification

- `python -m pytest tests/test_api_endpoints.py::test_graph_approval_returns_before_resume_and_keeps_one_activity_operation tests/test_response_document_contract.py tests/test_response_document_failures.py tests/test_typed_snapshot_presentation_contract.py tests/test_snapshot_timeline_final_response_contract.py tests/test_phase7_api_ui_alignment.py -q` -> 91 passed.
- `node --test --test-concurrency=1 "src/components/features/chat/factory-agent/responseDocumentReducer.test.mjs"` -> 11 passed.
- `git diff --check` -> passed with line-ending warnings only.

## Post-Gate Regression: Chat 514 Orphan IDLE Diagnostic

Date: 2026-05-18

Status: Fixed in Phase 10; later phases add broader transition/probe hardening.

### Symptom

- Manual browser screenshot shows active chat `Chat 514` with the user prompt `change all medium priority job to high then change all high priority job to low`.
- Assistant bubble renders:
  - `Needs attention`;
  - `The request needs attention before it can continue.`;
  - technical details containing `Reason: non_terminal_snapshot` and `Session status: IDLE`.
- Header shows `Ready`, while the sidebar row for the same chat can still show `WAITING FOR APPROVAL`.

### Why This Page Exists

- `response_document` is doing what it was told for an impossible state: it received a snapshot that looked non-terminal and not actionable.
- The backend snapshot had enough state to render a diagnostic, but not enough state to prove the request was running, waiting for approval, completed, cancelled, blocked, or failed.
- For a normal sent prompt, `IDLE + non_terminal_snapshot + no terminal result` is not a valid user-facing state. It should be prevented upstream or converted into a clear blocked/failure reason.

### Why Existing E2E Did Not Catch It

- The response-document E2E gate focused on mocked fixtures whose revisions and terminal states were already well shaped.
- Existing backend tests asserted many final states, but did not encode the invariant: "after the latest user message, a normal actionable prompt must not settle as IDLE with no terminal/pending/failure state."
- Existing browser tests often checked final success or specific blocks, but did not globally forbid `non_terminal_snapshot` / `Session status: IDLE` / generic `Needs attention` for normal prompts.
- Full Playwright snapshots are too long and low-signal; they show the page but do not directly compare UI header/sidebar/status with backend snapshot and response-document state.

### Testing Direction

- Phase 10 blocks the invalid backend state and adds the first executable Chat 514 regression.
- Phase 11 adds visible transition oracles.
- Phase 12 improves artifacts with compact semantic probes.
- Phase 13 forces every manual screenshot bug into a regression bank and executable test.
