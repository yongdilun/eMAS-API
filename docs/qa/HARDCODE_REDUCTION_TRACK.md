# Hardcoded Logic Reduction Tracker

Branch: `codex/playwright-e2e-plan`
Baseline commit observed: `3e50209 test: add semantic routing contract`

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Status | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Hardcode inventory and classification | Complete | Codex | Completed as docs-only inventory. No product or test behavior changes. Next action is Phase 1. |
| 1 | Guard semantic routing against overfitting | Complete | Codex | Added route-family semantic contract matrix, production hardcode guard, and fixed job-id fragment entity leakage. |
| 2 | Capability-based tool selection | Complete | Codex | Semantic route tool selection now uses capability metadata before legacy endpoint-name fallback. |
| 3 | Knowledge policy registry | Complete | Codex | Moved OSHA/LOTO fallback answer, sources, and safety content into a route-scoped RAG knowledge policy registry. |
| 4 | SSE fault injection Adapter | Complete | Codex | Seeded duplicate/out-of-order/drop/reconnect hooks now live behind `factory_agent.testing.fault_injection`; production router uses the no-op adapter by default. |
| 5 | Data-driven seeded scenario engine | Complete | Codex | Explicit Phase 9/10/14/19 seeded prompt selectors now live in `testing_seeded_scenarios.py`; `testing_seeded_adapters.py` delegates to scenario data and keeps only generic non-phase fallback/resume handling. |
| 6 | Typed snapshot presentation contract | Complete | Codex | Backend snapshots and terminal timeline events now include typed `presentation` evidence for approvals, mutations, partial failures, diagnostics, cancellation, rejected/expired approvals, and source-backed knowledge answers. |
| 7 | Frontend typed presentation rendering | Complete | Codex | Frontend turn summaries, final tables/sources/diagnostics, pending approval copy, and activity timeline now prefer typed `presentation` state before legacy text parsing. |
| 8 | Hardcode guardrails in CI | Complete | Codex | Added blocking pytest guardrails to the backend oracle command. Resume scenario growth after this. |
| 9 | Route-to-execution validation and loop guard | Complete | Codex | Added route-to-execution contracts, schema/profile-driven read-only entity-id repair, bounded decision-guard diagnostics, seeded machine-status fixture runtime intent, and real LangGraph proof for `What is the status of M-CNC-01?`. |

## Current Blockers

- Manual failure confirmed after Phase 8: `What is the status of M-CNC-01?` can loop at `decision_guard` because generated tool args violate the hard `machine_id = M-CNC-01` constraint.
- The failure must be fixed before broad new scenario discovery resumes; otherwise more tests can still pass at semantic/seeded layers while real LangGraph times out.
- None confirmed for Phase 2. Capability metadata is sufficient for the semantic route families covered here; endpoint fallback remains for untagged legacy tools.
- Potential blocker: frontend may need legacy text parsing for old sessions until typed presentation is fully deployed.

## Open Questions

- Should route-family definitions live in Python data structures first or external JSON/YAML registry?
- Should curated knowledge fallbacks eventually be product-owned content in external data instead of Python registry data?
- What typed presentation schema should be considered stable enough for frontend use?
- Which seeded planner scenarios should migrate first: approval chains, SSE faults, or RAG/source flows?
- Answered: hardcode guardrails are blocking in `npm run test:backend-oracles` because the focused allowlist kept false positives low.
- Phase 9 root cause: semantic routing and tool selection were correct, but deterministic planner repair did not copy explicit entity constraints into compatible read-only entity lookup args after the model produced a wrong-domain/wrong-id decision. The decision guard preserved `machine_id = M-CNC-01`, blocked execution, and repeatedly routed to planner repair with no bounded terminal diagnostic.

## Decisions Made

- Do not fix every hardcoded value blindly.
- Product hardcodes and runtime test hooks are higher priority than fixture constants.
- Seeded IDs such as `JOB-SEED-*` and `M-CNC-01` are acceptable in fixture/test data when not driving production behavior.
- New scenario discovery should pause except for regressions found while reducing hardcodes.
- Browser tests should only be added when visible UI can diverge from lower-layer route/state evidence.
- Phase 0 is complete as a documentation-only inventory: no product code and no test behavior were changed.
- Fixture constants remain accepted only when they live in fixture/spec support paths and do not drive product routing.
- Phase 1 found and fixed a product routing bug where a hyphenated job id such as `JOB-ABC-123` could leak an inner `ABC-123` machine id into `normalized_entities`.
- Phase 2 found and fixed product routing bugs where individual job deletes were classified as dangerous bulk deletes, `JOB-*` IDs without digits were not normalized, create-job shorthand such as `create job P-005` did not preserve the product id, and read-style schedule explanation prompts were treated as incomplete job mutations.
- Phase 3 keeps curated OSHA/LOTO fallback knowledge product-owned behind `factory_agent.rag.knowledge_policy`; the first policy is route-scoped to LOTO/safety RAG routes and does not apply to unrelated procedure prompts.
- Phase 4 keeps normal SSE stream semantics in `factory_agent.api.routers.events`; seeded Playwright SSE diagnostics and fault behavior are isolated behind `factory_agent.testing.fault_injection`.
- Phase 4 exposed and fixed related product bugs: bare `run` wording no longer implies a job mutation without a write verb; synthetic completion projection now preserves operator-facing tool result messages, uses step index as a tie-breaker for same-timestamp tool results, and the frontend sorts same-timestamp tool rows plus surfaces extra answer-model fields beside tables.
- Phase 5 migrated scenario prompt matching into `factory_agent.testing_seeded_scenarios`, while `testing_seeded_adapters.py` delegates execution to existing seeded helper methods. No production behavior changes are intended.
- Phase 5 exposed and fixed an import-order product bug where importing `factory_agent.api.response_mappers` could eagerly import routes and circularly re-enter `session_snapshot_service`; `factory_agent.api.build_router` is now lazy. It also exposed a seeded-mode routing bug where semantic clarification intercepted known seeded Phase 14 oracle prompts before the seeded planner could handle them; normal production planners still clarify those prompts, while the seeded planner now advertises the fixture prompts it owns.
- Phase 5 follow-up removed the remaining explicit `if "phase ..."` prompt selectors from `SeededPlaywrightPlanner.generate_plan`. The remaining adapter conditionals are scenario-marker resume dispatch or generic fallback behavior, not phase-prompt routing.
- Phase 6 added an additive typed presentation contract to backend snapshot payloads and terminal timeline events. Legacy text fields remain in place, but contract tests now assert state from `presentation.kind`, `presentation.state`, ids, row outcomes, sources, diagnostics, and invariant flags before checking display text compatibility. No frontend Phase 7 rendering migration was done.
- Phase 7 migrated frontend rendering to prefer typed `presentation` evidence while keeping legacy phrase parsing for snapshots without `presentation`. It exposed and fixed a product bug where a terse typed failed diagnostic (`HTTP 500`) could hide richer safe recovery guidance (`Please retry`) already present in the failed plan explanation; typed failed state remains authoritative, but safe diagnostic prose is preserved.
- Phase 8 guardrails are blocking through `eMas Front/package.json` `test:backend-oracles`. They scan product/runtime code for Phase 9/10/14/19 prompt branches, seeded phase strings in product routes, missing-entity defaults to `M-CNC-01`/`JOB-SEED-*`, and new frontend phrase-based state fallbacks outside the explicit allowlist.
- Phase 8 exposed and fixed a seeded adapter issue: generic seeded machine/job status paths defaulted missing machine/job IDs to `M-CNC-01` and `JOB-SEED-001`. The adapter now requires explicit IDs, while existing Phase 10 release machine-status prompts are represented as fixture data in `testing_seeded_scenarios.py`.
- Phase 9 was added because Phase 1/2/8 proved routing/tool-selection/hardcode safety, but did not prove that the real LangGraph planner preserves explicit constraints through executable tool args and decision guard acceptance.

## Phase 0 Inventory

Inventory command families used:

- `rg -n -i "phase 9|phase 14|phase 19|M-CNC-01|JOB-SEED|playwright_seeded|seeded_playwright|fallback|please approve|will be updated from|risk summary|run complete|get__jobs|put__jobs_\{id\}" ...`
- `rg -n -i "if .*lower|in lowered|includes\(|current_intent|prompt|semantic_frame|_semantic_route_tool_names|_fallback_knowledge_answer|_snapshot_intent_contains|approvalWaitSummary|isApprovalWaitText|isPlanLikeAnswer" ...`

### Inventory Summary

| Classification | Count | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `product-risk` | 10 | Production code branches on wording, literal endpoint names, or embedded answer content. |
| `runtime-test-hook` | 2 | Playwright seeded behavior is reachable from production router code paths, gated by environment. |
| `test-infra-risk` | 3 | Test adapters/mock servers are intentionally deterministic but are becoming duplicate product implementations. |
| `acceptable-fixture` | 5 | Fixture constants or assertions are isolated in test data/specs and should remain explicit. |

### Product And Runtime Risks

| ID | Priority | Classification | File/module | Evidence | Why it matters | Desired seam or replacement | Decision |

| P0-02 | Critical | `product-risk` | `eMas Front/src/components/features/chat/turns/turnAssembler.js` | `isPlanLikeAnswer`, `isApprovalWaitText`, and `stripApprovalWaitPhrases` inspect `risk summary:`, `please approve`, `will be updated from`, and `waiting for your approval` at lines 40-58 and 426-435; final summary routing uses those helpers at lines 503-516. | Frontend can render the wrong final answer or hide/show approval copy based on text wording instead of backend state. | Render from typed presentation/activity state first; retain phrase parsing only for legacy sessions. | Defer to Phase 7 after Phase 6. |
| P0-03 | High | `product-risk` | `eMas Front/src/components/features/chat/factory-agent/FactoryAgentChatPanel.jsx` | `isPlanLikeAnswer` filters `risk summary:` at lines 43-49; `approvalWaitSummary` checks `please approve` and `will be updated from` at lines 335-340; table hiding uses text-vs-table contradiction heuristics at lines 374-454. | UI presentation can be driven by narrative wording, causing stale approval bundles or stale tables to win over actual operation state. | Use typed write-bundle/table presentation metadata with explicit stale-state flags and operation ids. | Defer to Phase 7. |
| P0-04 | High | `product-risk` | `eMas Front/src/components/features/chat/factory-agent/activityTimelineUtils.js` | Activity state maps `session_completed` to visible `Run complete` at line 164 and line 588; active-session cleanup drops rows whose label is `run complete` at line 83; later fallback injects `Run complete` from session status at line 839. | Timeline truth depends partly on display labels, so wording changes or stale terminal rows can change activity state. | Use backend-provided typed activity steps as authoritative; keep local timeline builder as a compatibility fallback. | Defer to Phase 7. |
| P0-05 | High | `product-risk` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/planning/tool_selector.py` | `_semantic_route_tool_names` maps semantic routes directly to endpoint names such as `get__machines_{id}`, `get__jobs`, `get__jobs_{id}`, `put__jobs_{id}`, and `patch__jobs_{id}` at lines 802-840. | Semantic routing can break when OpenAPI operation names change even when capabilities remain equivalent. | Capability selector keyed by entity/action/safety/endpoint shape, with endpoint-name fallback only for incomplete metadata. | Defer to Phase 2. |
| P0-06 | High | `product-risk` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/planning/tool_selector.py` | `_diagnostic_tool_names` contains prompt substring shortcuts for `network` + `timeout`, `404` + `read`, low/medium/high/urgent priority job mutations, and `create job` at lines 850-883. | These are production fast paths that can overfit test prompts and bypass broader retrieval/rerank scoring. | Move diagnostic scenario handling behind capability/profile tests or a data-driven diagnostic registry. | Defer; include guard in Phase 1/2 tests. |
| P0-07 | Medium | `product-risk` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/planning/intent.py` | Route-family behavior is encoded in regex constants such as `_ACTION_PATTERNS`, `_LOTO_HINT_RE`, priority-change regexes, and semantic branches; representative hits at lines 73, 104, 137-145, 559-587, and 871. | The semantic frame is useful, but adding new document families can become more Python branch sprawl. | Route-family registry for aliases, required entities, clarification copy, negative routes, and confidence policy. | Defer to Phase 1. |
| P0-08 | Medium | `product-risk` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/services/plan_creation_service.py` | `_fallback_knowledge_answer` embeds OSHA/LOTO answer text, `29 CFR 1910.147`, source metadata, and safety copy at lines 259-289; fallback is merged into RAG responses at lines 350-370. | Product content and source policy are hidden in service logic, making safety/source changes code changes. | Knowledge policy registry with policy id, route family, source metadata, answer template, and allowed environments. | Defer to Phase 3. |
| P0-09 | Medium | `product-risk` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/services/plan_creation_service.py` | Clarification replies are hardcoded in service methods at lines 307-318, including exact LOTO and live-status machine-id prompts. | Prompt copy is part of routing policy and can drift from semantic missing-entity rules. | Store clarification templates alongside semantic route/required-entity policy. | Defer to Phase 1 or Phase 3 depending on registry shape. |
| P0-10 | Medium | `product-risk` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/graph/nodes/planner_loop.py`, `factory-agent/factory_agent/graph/planner_graph_helpers.py`, `factory-agent/factory_agent/graph/planner_graph.py` | Additional production graph paths reference literal `get__jobs`, `get__jobs_{id}`, and `put__jobs_{id}` in search hits such as `graph/nodes/planner_loop.py` lines 421, 475, 491, 565, 568; `graph/planner_graph_helpers.py` lines 724-731 and 795-830; `graph/planner_graph.py` lines 88-112. | Capability-based selection will be incomplete if graph execution keeps independent endpoint-name contracts. | Reuse the same capability/tool-profile seam as Phase 2 for graph planner helpers. | Defer to Phase 2 follow-up scope. |
| P0-11 | High | `runtime-test-hook` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/api/routers/events.py` | Production router defines `_seeded_playwright_mode`, `_playwright/sse-connections`, and records `playwright_seeded_sse_connections` at lines 24-74. | Test-only observability endpoint and state live in the production router, even though gated by environment. | Fault/connection recording adapter installed only for seeded/test runtime. | Defer to Phase 4. |
| P0-12 | Critical | `runtime-test-hook` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/api/routers/events.py` | Activity and notification streams branch on seeded mode and prompt text: `phase 9 out-of-order duplicate sse` at lines 285-286, `phase 9 last-event-id reconnect`, `phase 9 stream drop recovery`, and `phase 14 stream drop commit recovery` at lines 358-369. | Runtime stream behavior can diverge by user prompt content in a production route. | Production no-op fault adapter plus seeded Playwright fault adapter; no prompt substring checks in route loops. | Defer to Phase 4. |

### Test Infrastructure Risks

| ID | Priority | Classification | File/module | Evidence | Why it matters | Desired seam or replacement | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0-13 | High | `test-infra-risk` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/testing_seeded_adapters.py` | `SeededPlaywrightPlanner.generate_plan` branches on many prompt substrings including `phase 9 multi-step ordered`, `phase 9 stream drop recovery`, `phase 14 bulk partial failure`, `phase 14 go api 500 commit failure`, and `phase 19` at lines 155-391. | Test-only, but it is becoming a second planner whose behavior is encoded in Python branches. | Data-driven seeded scenario engine and generic interpreter. | Defer to Phase 5. |
| P0-14 | High | `test-infra-risk` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/testing_seeded_adapters.py` | Seeded planner falls back to fixture IDs such as `M-CNC-01` and `JOB-SEED-001` at lines 633 and 650; phase-specific write scenarios hardcode `JOB-SEED-005`, `JOB-SEED-009`, and `JOB-SEED-MISSING-014` at lines 1155, 1230-1243, 1454-1489, and 1517-1584. | Valid for seeded tests, but fallback IDs inside planner code can mask missing entity extraction if reused outside seeded mode. | Move fixture IDs into scenario data; interpreter must require explicit scenario fixtures. | Defer to Phase 5. |
| P0-15 | Medium | `test-infra-risk` | `eMas Front/e2e/mock-server/fixtureStore.js` | Mock server routes scenarios from prompt constants and prompt banks, with `prompts:` arrays and `phase19UnknownPrompt` hits at lines 52-58, 871-884, 965-984, and 1007-1035. | Mock browser tests rely on prompt-string routing; acceptable for mocks, but it should stay visibly outside product and not guide production behavior. | Keep in mock adapter; prefer scenario ids/fixture metadata for new mocked cases. | Keep for now; revisit with Phase 5 guardrails. |

### Accepted Fixture Constants

| ID | Priority | Classification | File/module | Evidence | Why it matters | Desired seam or replacement | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0-16 | Low | `acceptable-fixture` | `eMas Front/e2e/fixtures/factoryAgentFixtures.js` | Canonical happy-path prompt/answer uses `M-CNC-01` at lines 1-4; SSE/retry prompts use the same fixture machine at lines 13-31 and 43; fixture activity rows include `Run complete` at lines 278 and 318. | These are explicit browser fixture rows, not product routing. | Keep in fixture module; do not copy into product code. | Accepted fixture. |
| P0-17 | Low | `acceptable-fixture` | `eMas Front/e2e/support/dataIntegrityScenarios.js`, `eMas Front/e2e/support/realLangGraphScenarios.js` | Canonical `JOB-SEED-001` through `JOB-SEED-026` priority maps appear at lines 9-34 in both support files. | Seeded data integrity checks need stable expected DB rows. | Keep as canonical fixture data; reference by scenario id where possible. | Accepted fixture. |
| P0-18 | Low | `acceptable-fixture` | `eMas Front/e2e/support/intentEntityScenarios.js`, `tests/e2e/scenarios/manual_prompt_regressions.json` | LOTO prompt variants and expected source metadata use `M-CNC-01`, `JOB-SEED-001`, and `LOTO-M-CNC-01` at lines 16-42. | Manual regression bank needs fixed prompts and expected source evidence. | Keep as prompt-bank fixture; product route coverage should be asserted through semantic frame tests. | Accepted fixture. |
| P0-19 | Low | `acceptable-fixture` | `eMas Front/e2e/support/promptRegressionScenarios.js`, `eMas Front/e2e/specs/full-stack-prompt-workflow-regression.spec.js` | Phase 19 prompts and assertions include `Phase 19 prompt regression`, `M-CNC-01`, `JOB-SEED-LARGE-080`, and `Run complete` hits at support lines 13-60 and spec lines 283-377. | End-to-end regression specs intentionally assert user-visible outcomes. | Keep in Playwright fixtures/specs; do not use phase names in product routing. | Accepted fixture. |
| P0-20 | Low | `acceptable-fixture` | `eMas Front/e2e/support/syntheticEnv.js`, `eMas Front/e2e/specs/production-synthetic.spec.js` | Read-only production synthetic canary prompts use `M-CNC-01` at support lines 72-83 and specs assert `Run complete` structurally at lines 42-84 and 167. | Synthetic checks need stable read-only canary text but are not production logic. | Keep as explicit synthetic fixture; maintain read-only wording. | Accepted fixture. |

| `phase19_prompt_regression_dynamic_cascade` | SO-001 through SO-004, SO-041 prompt-regression bank | Generic cascade prompt parsing plus `phase 19`/prompt-regression audit selection | Scenario metadata marks prompt-regression cascades and keeps audit scenario `119`. |

| `phase9_isolation_beta` | SO-017 | `if "phase 9 isolation beta" in lowered` | Scenario metadata drives isolation fixture beta. |

#### Phase 5 Legacy Seeded Branches Remaining

These remain intentionally in the adapter as non-phase fallback or resume mechanics:

- Scenario-marker resume dispatch for Phase 14 and multi-approval workflows after an approval bundle is already staged.
- Generic fallback branches: low-priority approval workflow, cancel, SSE/activity/stream, job lookup, job collection, low-priority job list, machine status.
- Fixture IDs inside seeded helper methods (`M-CNC-01`, `JOB-SEED-*`) remain test fixture data rather than prompt-routing branches.

### Phase 6: Typed Snapshot Presentation Contract

- [x] Define backend typed presentation payload.
- [x] Add typed operation/final/approval/source/diagnostic states to snapshot.
- [x] Preserve legacy text fields.
- [x] Add contract tests that assert typed state and reject stale text-only state.
- [x] Run snapshot/final response and API/UI alignment tests.

#### Phase 6 Typed Presentation Coverage

| Contract area | Evidence now asserted through typed fields |
| --- | --- |
| Pending approval | `presentation.kind=approval_required`, `state=pending`, `approval_id`, pending row evidence, and `full_success_forbidden`. |
| Rejected approval | `kind=rejected`, `state=rejected`, rejection diagnostics, and terminal event presentation cannot be overridden by stale success text. |
| Expired/stale approval | `kind=expired`, `state=expired`, expired row evidence, and diagnostic reason `approval_expired`. |
| Partial failure | `kind=partial_failure`, `state=failed`, per-row succeeded/failed outcomes, and row-status invariants. |
| Successful mutation | `kind=mutation_result`, `state=completed`, operation id, approval id, changed rows, and multi-approval row evidence. |
| Cancellation | `kind=cancelled`, `state=cancelled`, and cancellation diagnostics. |
| RAG/knowledge answer | `kind=knowledge_answer`, `state=completed`, and typed source metadata. |
| Empty final response | `kind=diagnostic`, `state=failed`, `diagnostics.reason=empty_final_response`, not fake success. |
| Stale success text | Pending, rejected, failed, and partial-failure typed states win before legacy success-like prose. |

### Phase 7: Frontend Typed Presentation Rendering

- [x] Teach turn assembler to prefer typed presentation blocks.
- [x] Teach activity timeline to prefer typed state.
- [x] Keep legacy text parser as fallback.
- [x] Add component tests with changed wording but same typed state.
- [x] Add browser test proving stale hidden text cannot override typed state.
- [x] Run frontend unit and seeded browser suites.

#### Phase 7 Typed Frontend Coverage

| Frontend area | Typed evidence now preferred |
| --- | --- |
| Turn summary | `presentation.kind/state/summary` decide pending, completed, rejected, expired, cancelled, failed, knowledge answer, and answer copy before phrase checks. |
| Mutation table | `presentation.rows` builds the affected-record table for mutation results and partial failures, independent of summary wording. |
| Source chrome | `presentation.sources` populates source chips and inline citation metadata for knowledge answers without relying on `details.sources` or exact answer text. |
| Diagnostics | `presentation.diagnostics` and failed typed state prevent stale success text from showing; richer safe failure guidance remains visible when the typed summary is only a terse error. |
| Activity timeline | Snapshot/event `presentation.state` suppresses stale `Run complete`, stale `Improving the response`, and stale `Current` rows for pending/rejected/failed/expired/cancelled states. |
| Legacy fallback | `isApprovalWaitText`, `isPlanLikeAnswer`, approval phrase cleanup, and old table/source details remain for snapshots without `presentation`. |

### Phase 8: Hardcode Guardrails In CI

- [x] Add hardcode guard pytest.
- [x] Add fixture allowlist.
- [x] Add product-code denylist for phase prompt branches and seeded mode branches.
- [x] Decide warning vs blocking mode.
- [x] Wire into backend oracle command or documented release gate.
- [x] Update README/QA docs with hardcode policy.

#### Phase 8 Guardrail Coverage

| Guardrail | Blocking rule | Allowlist |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase prompt branches | `if` conditions in runtime files must not branch on Phase 9/10/14/19 prompt strings. | Phase prompt triggers belong in `factory_agent/testing_seeded_scenarios.py` or test/e2e/docs fixtures. |
| Product seeded prompt strings | `intent.py`, `tool_selector.py`, `plan_creation_service.py`, and `events.py` must not embed Phase 9/10/14/19 prompt strings. | Fixture/test/data paths only. |
| Missing entity defaults | Runtime and seeded adapter paths must not turn missing `machine_id`/`job_id` into `M-CNC-01` or `JOB-SEED-*`. | Explicit fixture IDs may remain in scenario data, tests, e2e fixtures, and docs. |
| Frontend phrase state | Core chat rendering files may not add new `please approve`, `will be updated from`, `risk summary`, `run complete`, or `all requested changes completed` state fallbacks beyond the explicit count/reason allowlist. | Existing legacy fallback helpers and typed presentation display labels remain documented until old snapshots no longer need them. |

### Phase 9: Route-To-Execution Validation And Loop Guard

- [x] Reproduce `What is the status of M-CNC-01?` at the lowest useful backend layer.
- [x] Capture semantic frame, selected scoped tools, pending decision, proposed tool args, decision guard output, failed strategies, and planner loop count for the failing prompt.
- [x] Add a route-to-execution contract test harness for semantic route -> selected capability -> generated decision -> sanitized args -> decision guard -> execution/final diagnostic.
- [x] Add canonical machine-status coverage for `What is the status of M-CNC-01?`.
- [x] Add wording variants for the same route without adding production prompt branches.
- [x] Add adjacent controls for job status/list and LOTO/RAG so the fix cannot overfit machine status.
- [x] Add a bounded-loop test proving repeated decision-guard constraint failures produce typed diagnostics instead of timeout.
- [x] Fix the actual seam: wrong-domain decision, arg propagation, alias mapping, arg sanitation, or repair logic.
- [x] Add seeded browser proof for the canonical prompt.
- [x] Add real LangGraph critical proof for the canonical prompt when runtime cost allows.
- [x] Run backend oracle, hardcode guardrail, seeded browser, and focused real LangGraph commands.

#### Phase 9 Initial Failure Evidence

| Prompt | Observed result | What this proves | Required blocker test |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `What is the status of M-CNC-01?` | `next_route=continue_planner`, `kind=constraint_violation`, `phase=decision_guard`, `summary=Skipped tool execution; routing to planner for repair.`, hard constraint `machine_id = M-CNC-01`, pending summary says `Querying the status of slot for machine M-CNC-01`, and `tool_calls=[]` after guard blocking. | Existing tests verify extraction, route selection, typed rendering, and hardcode policy, but not that the real planner preserves explicit constraints in executable args accepted by the decision guard. | The route-to-execution contract must fail when a read-only machine-status prompt reaches decision guard with missing/wrong machine args, wrong-domain `slot` planning, or repeated repair loops. |

#### Phase 9 Route Matrix Candidates

| Prompt | Expected route family | Required executable evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `What is the status of M-CNC-01?` | `tool.read.machine_status` | Machine read call preserves `M-CNC-01` through `id`, `machine_id`, `machine_ref`, or a profiled machine id alias; terminal response is a machine-status answer or typed diagnostic. |
| `Show status for machine M-CNC-01` | `tool.read.machine_status` | Same as canonical case, with no wording-specific branch. |
| `Is M-CNC-01 running?` | `tool.read.machine_status` | Same as canonical case, with live-state wording. |
| `What is the current condition of m-cnc-01?` | `tool.read.machine_status` | Same as canonical case, case-normalized. |
| `Show machine M-CNC-01 health` | `tool.read.machine_status` | Same as canonical case, synonym wording. |
| `What is the status of job JOB-SEED-001?` | `tool.read.jobs` | Job read call preserves `JOB-SEED-001`; no machine-status repair path is used. |
| `Show high priority jobs` | `tool.read.jobs` | Job list/read call preserves priority filter when available or returns a safe typed diagnostic. |
| `What LOTO procedure applies before working on M-CNC-01?` | `rag.loto_procedure` | RAG/procedure route still bypasses machine live-status execution and renders typed source evidence. |

#### Phase 9 Results

- Backend reproduction matched the manual failure: semantic route `tool.read.machine_status`, selected tool `get__machines_{id}`, bad proposed args `{"id": "5"}`, hard constraint `machine_id = M-CNC-01`, decision guard `kind=constraint_violation`, `next_route=continue_planner`, and `tool_calls=[]`.
- Product fix: `planner_graph_helpers.py` now performs generic schema/profile-driven read-only entity lookup repair, copying explicit intent entity IDs into required lookup args only when the tool profile is compatible. It does not branch on `What is the status of M-CNC-01?` and does not default missing ids.
- Loop guard fix: `planner_loop.py` now counts repeated decision-guard constraint failures for the current intent and emits a typed diagnostic after the configured repair limit instead of recursing until timeout.
- Seeded fixture fix: Phase 9 seeded machine-status scenarios now provide explicit `runtime_intent` fixture text so the seeded helper exercises explicit-id behavior without reintroducing `M-CNC-01` defaults.
- Browser proof exposed an adjacent product bug: rich completed mutation summaries could be overwritten by stale read-tool summaries. `session_snapshot_service.py` now preserves rich mutation completions, and `turnAssembler.js` ranks terminal/snapshot typed presentations above later event-local tool presentations.

## Next Action

Phase 9 is complete. Next hardcode-reduction work should begin from the remaining open risk table items rather than the machine-status decision-guard loop, which is now covered by route-to-execution contracts and real LangGraph proof.
