# Hardcoded Logic Reduction Tracker

Branch: `codex/playwright-e2e-plan`
Baseline commit observed: `3e50209 test: add semantic routing contract`

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Status | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Hardcode inventory and classification | Complete | Codex | Completed as docs-only inventory. No product or test behavior changes. Next action is Phase 1. |
| 1 | Guard semantic routing against overfitting | Not Started | Next agent | Semantic frame exists; now prevent route-family sprawl. |
| 2 | Capability-based tool selection | Not Started | Next agent | Replace literal endpoint mapping gradually. |
| 3 | Knowledge policy registry | Not Started | Next agent | Move OSHA/LOTO fallback out of service code. |
| 4 | SSE fault injection Adapter | Not Started | Next agent | Move Playwright seeded fault hooks out of production SSE route logic. |
| 5 | Data-driven seeded scenario engine | Not Started | Next agent | Highest effort. Migrate scenario branches incrementally. |
| 6 | Typed snapshot presentation contract | Not Started | Next agent | Backend contract needed before frontend cleanup. |
| 7 | Frontend typed presentation rendering | Not Started | Next agent | Remove primary dependence on text phrase inference. |
| 8 | Hardcode guardrails in CI | Not Started | Next agent | Resume scenario growth after this. |

## Current Blockers

- None confirmed.
- Potential blocker: tool capability metadata may not be rich enough to replace endpoint-name mapping immediately.
- Potential blocker: frontend may need legacy text parsing for old sessions until typed presentation is fully deployed.

## Open Questions

- Should route-family definitions live in Python data structures first or external JSON/YAML registry?
- Should curated knowledge fallbacks be product-owned content or test-owned seeded content?
- What typed presentation schema should be considered stable enough for frontend use?
- Which seeded planner scenarios should migrate first: approval chains, SSE faults, or RAG/source flows?
- Should hardcode guardrails start as blocking CI or warning-only?

## Decisions Made

- Do not fix every hardcoded value blindly.
- Product hardcodes and runtime test hooks are higher priority than fixture constants.
- Seeded IDs such as `JOB-SEED-*` and `M-CNC-01` are acceptable in fixture/test data when not driving production behavior.
- New scenario discovery should pause except for regressions found while reducing hardcodes.
- Browser tests should only be added when visible UI can diverge from lower-layer route/state evidence.
- Phase 0 is complete as a documentation-only inventory: no product code and no test behavior were changed.
- Fixture constants remain accepted only when they live in fixture/spec support paths and do not drive product routing.

## Phase 0 Inventory

Inventory command families used:

- `rg -n -i "phase 9|phase 14|phase 19|M-CNC-01|JOB-SEED|playwright_seeded|seeded_playwright|fallback|please approve|will be updated from|risk summary|run complete|get__jobs|put__jobs_\{id\}" ...`
- `rg -n -i "if .*lower|in lowered|includes\(|current_intent|prompt|semantic_frame|_semantic_route_tool_names|_fallback_knowledge_answer|_snapshot_intent_contains|approvalWaitSummary|isApprovalWaitText|isPlanLikeAnswer" ...`

### Inventory Summary

| Classification | Count | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `product-risk` | 10 | Production code branches on wording, literal endpoint names, or embedded answer content. |
| `runtime-test-hook` | 2 | Playwright seeded behavior is reachable from production router code paths, gated by environment. |
| `test-infra-risk` | 3 | Test adapters/mock servers are intentionally deterministic but are becoming duplicate product implementations. |
| `acceptable-fixture` | 5 | Fixture constants or assertions are isolated in test data/specs and should remain explicit. |

### Product And Runtime Risks

| ID | Priority | Classification | File/module | Evidence | Why it matters | Desired seam or replacement | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0-01 | Critical | `product-risk` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/services/session_snapshot_service.py` | `_is_plan_like_completion_text`, `_is_approval_wait_text`, `_is_success_like_plan_text`, and `_is_failure_guidance_text` branch on `risk summary:`, `please approve`, `will be updated from`, `run complete`, `failed`, and `please retry` at lines 111-163; completion projection re-selects content from those helpers at lines 1387-1400. | Backend snapshot/final-response meaning can change when visible prose changes, creating stale approval or false success risk. | Typed presentation contract with explicit `kind`, `state`, operation id, approval id, row outcomes, and source state; text only as display copy. | Defer to Phase 6. |
| P0-02 | Critical | `product-risk` | `eMas Front/src/components/features/chat/turns/turnAssembler.js` | `isPlanLikeAnswer`, `isApprovalWaitText`, and `stripApprovalWaitPhrases` inspect `risk summary:`, `please approve`, `will be updated from`, and `waiting for your approval` at lines 40-58 and 426-435; final summary routing uses those helpers at lines 503-516. | Frontend can render the wrong final answer or hide/show approval copy based on text wording instead of backend state. | Render from typed presentation/activity state first; retain phrase parsing only for legacy sessions. | Defer to Phase 7 after Phase 6. |
| P0-03 | High | `product-risk` | `eMas Front/src/components/features/chat/factory-agent/FactoryAgentChatPanel.jsx` | `isPlanLikeAnswer` filters `risk summary:` at lines 43-49; `approvalWaitSummary` checks `please approve` and `will be updated from` at lines 335-340; table hiding uses text-vs-table contradiction heuristics at lines 374-454. | UI presentation can be driven by narrative wording, causing stale approval bundles or stale tables to win over actual operation state. | Use typed write-bundle/table presentation metadata with explicit stale-state flags and operation ids. | Defer to Phase 7. |
| P0-04 | High | `product-risk` | `eMas Front/src/components/features/chat/factory-agent/activityTimelineUtils.js` | Activity state maps `session_completed` to visible `Run complete` at line 164 and line 588; active-session cleanup drops rows whose label is `run complete` at line 83; later fallback injects `Run complete` from session status at line 839. | Timeline truth depends partly on display labels, so wording changes or stale terminal rows can change activity state. | Use backend-provided typed activity steps as authoritative; keep local timeline builder as a compatibility fallback. | Defer to Phase 7. |
| P0-05 | High | `product-risk` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/planning/tool_selector.py` | `_semantic_route_tool_names` maps semantic routes directly to endpoint names such as `get__machines_{id}`, `get__jobs`, `get__jobs_{id}`, `put__jobs_{id}`, and `patch__jobs_{id}` at lines 802-840. | Semantic routing can break when OpenAPI operation names change even when capabilities remain equivalent. | Capability selector keyed by entity/action/safety/endpoint shape, with endpoint-name fallback only for incomplete metadata. | Defer to Phase 2. |
| P0-06 | High | `product-risk` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/planning/tool_selector.py` | `_diagnostic_tool_names` contains prompt substring shortcuts for `network` + `timeout`, `404` + `read`, low/medium/high/urgent priority job mutations, and `create job` at lines 850-883. | These are production fast paths that can overfit test prompts and bypass broader retrieval/rerank scoring. | Move diagnostic scenario handling behind capability/profile tests or a data-driven diagnostic registry. | Defer; include guard in Phase 1/2 tests. |
| P0-07 | Medium | `product-risk` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/planning/intent.py` | Route-family behavior is encoded in regex constants such as `_ACTION_PATTERNS`, `_LOTO_HINT_RE`, priority-change regexes, and semantic branches; representative hits at lines 73, 104, 137-145, 559-587, and 871. | The semantic frame is useful, but adding new document families can become more Python branch sprawl. | Route-family registry for aliases, required entities, clarification copy, negative routes, and confidence policy. | Defer to Phase 1. |
| P0-08 | Medium | `product-risk` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/services/plan_creation_service.py` | `_fallback_knowledge_answer` embeds OSHA/LOTO answer text, `29 CFR 1910.147`, source metadata, and safety copy at lines 259-289; fallback is merged into RAG responses at lines 350-370. | Product content and source policy are hidden in service logic, making safety/source changes code changes. | Knowledge policy registry with policy id, route family, source metadata, answer template, and allowed environments. | Defer to Phase 3. |
| P0-09 | Medium | `product-risk` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/services/plan_creation_service.py` | Clarification replies are hardcoded in service methods at lines 307-318, including exact LOTO and live-status machine-id prompts. | Prompt copy is part of routing policy and can drift from semantic missing-entity rules. | Store clarification templates alongside semantic route/required-entity policy. | Defer to Phase 1 or Phase 3 depending on registry shape. |
| P0-10 | Medium | `product-risk` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/graph/nodes/planner_loop.py`, `factory-agent/factory_agent/graph/planner_graph_helpers.py`, `factory-agent/factory_agent/graph/planner_graph.py` | Additional production graph paths reference literal `get__jobs`, `get__jobs_{id}`, and `put__jobs_{id}` in search hits such as `graph/nodes/planner_loop.py` lines 421, 475, 491, 565, 568; `graph/planner_graph_helpers.py` lines 724-731 and 795-830; `graph/planner_graph.py` lines 88-112. | Capability-based selection will be incomplete if graph execution keeps independent endpoint-name contracts. | Reuse the same capability/tool-profile seam as Phase 2 for graph planner helpers. | Defer to Phase 2 follow-up scope. |
| P0-11 | High | `runtime-test-hook` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/api/routers/events.py` | Production router defines `_seeded_playwright_mode`, `_playwright/sse-connections`, and records `playwright_seeded_sse_connections` at lines 24-74. | Test-only observability endpoint and state live in the production router, even though gated by environment. | Fault/connection recording adapter installed only for seeded/test runtime. | Defer to Phase 4. |
| P0-12 | Critical | `runtime-test-hook` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/api/routers/events.py` | Activity and notification streams branch on seeded mode and prompt text: `phase 9 out-of-order duplicate sse` at lines 285-286, `phase 9 last-event-id reconnect`, `phase 9 stream drop recovery`, and `phase 14 stream drop commit recovery` at lines 358-369. | Runtime stream behavior can diverge by user prompt content in a production route. | Production no-op fault adapter plus seeded Playwright fault adapter; no prompt substring checks in route loops. | Defer to Phase 4. |

### Test Infrastructure Risks

| ID | Priority | Classification | File/module | Evidence | Why it matters | Desired seam or replacement | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0-13 | High | `test-infra-risk` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/testing_seeded_adapters.py` | `SeededPlaywrightPlanner.generate_plan` branches on many prompt substrings including `phase 9 multi-step ordered`, `phase 9 stream drop recovery`, `phase 14 bulk partial failure`, `phase 14 go api 500 commit failure`, and `phase 19` at lines 155-391. | Test-only, but it is becoming a second planner whose behavior is encoded in Python branches. | Data-driven seeded scenario engine and generic interpreter. | Defer to Phase 5. |
| P0-14 | High | `test-infra-risk` | `factory-agent/factory_agent/testing_seeded_adapters.py` | Seeded planner falls back to fixture IDs such as `M-CNC-01` and `JOB-SEED-001` at lines 633 and 650; phase-specific write scenarios hardcode `JOB-SEED-005`, `JOB-SEED-009`, and `JOB-SEED-MISSING-014` at lines 1155, 1230-1243, 1454-1489, and 1517-1584. | Valid for seeded tests, but fallback IDs inside planner code can mask missing entity extraction if reused outside seeded mode. | Move fixture IDs into scenario data; interpreter must require explicit scenario fixtures. | Defer to Phase 5. |
| P0-15 | Medium | `test-infra-risk` | `eMas Front/e2e/mock-server/fixtureStore.js` | Mock server routes scenarios from prompt constants and prompt banks, with `prompts:` arrays and `phase19UnknownPrompt` hits at lines 52-58, 871-884, 965-984, and 1007-1035. | Mock browser tests rely on prompt-string routing; acceptable for mocks, but it should stay visibly outside product and not guide production behavior. | Keep in mock adapter; prefer scenario ids/fixture metadata for new mocked cases. | Keep for now; revisit with Phase 5 guardrails. |

### Accepted Fixture Constants

| ID | Priority | Classification | File/module | Evidence | Why it matters | Desired seam or replacement | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0-16 | Low | `acceptable-fixture` | `eMas Front/e2e/fixtures/factoryAgentFixtures.js` | Canonical happy-path prompt/answer uses `M-CNC-01` at lines 1-4; SSE/retry prompts use the same fixture machine at lines 13-31 and 43; fixture activity rows include `Run complete` at lines 278 and 318. | These are explicit browser fixture rows, not product routing. | Keep in fixture module; do not copy into product code. | Accepted fixture. |
| P0-17 | Low | `acceptable-fixture` | `eMas Front/e2e/support/dataIntegrityScenarios.js`, `eMas Front/e2e/support/realLangGraphScenarios.js` | Canonical `JOB-SEED-001` through `JOB-SEED-026` priority maps appear at lines 9-34 in both support files. | Seeded data integrity checks need stable expected DB rows. | Keep as canonical fixture data; reference by scenario id where possible. | Accepted fixture. |
| P0-18 | Low | `acceptable-fixture` | `eMas Front/e2e/support/intentEntityScenarios.js`, `tests/e2e/scenarios/manual_prompt_regressions.json` | LOTO prompt variants and expected source metadata use `M-CNC-01`, `JOB-SEED-001`, and `LOTO-M-CNC-01` at lines 16-42. | Manual regression bank needs fixed prompts and expected source evidence. | Keep as prompt-bank fixture; product route coverage should be asserted through semantic frame tests. | Accepted fixture. |
| P0-19 | Low | `acceptable-fixture` | `eMas Front/e2e/support/promptRegressionScenarios.js`, `eMas Front/e2e/specs/full-stack-prompt-workflow-regression.spec.js` | Phase 19 prompts and assertions include `Phase 19 prompt regression`, `M-CNC-01`, `JOB-SEED-LARGE-080`, and `Run complete` hits at support lines 13-60 and spec lines 283-377. | End-to-end regression specs intentionally assert user-visible outcomes. | Keep in Playwright fixtures/specs; do not use phase names in product routing. | Accepted fixture. |
| P0-20 | Low | `acceptable-fixture` | `eMas Front/e2e/support/syntheticEnv.js`, `eMas Front/e2e/specs/production-synthetic.spec.js` | Read-only production synthetic canary prompts use `M-CNC-01` at support lines 72-83 and specs assert `Run complete` structurally at lines 42-84 and 167. | Synthetic checks need stable read-only canary text but are not production logic. | Keep as explicit synthetic fixture; maintain read-only wording. | Accepted fixture. |

## Test Results

- `git status --short --branch`: confirmed branch `codex/playwright-e2e-plan`; only the two QA docs were untracked/changed during Phase 0.
- `git diff --check`: passed for the documentation-only working tree.
- Product tests were not run because Phase 0 is documentation-only and does not change product or test behavior.
- Baseline reported by user for semantic routing commit:
  - `python -m pytest tests/test_intent_splitter.py tests/test_phase19_prompt_workflow_regression.py -q`: 63 passed
  - Compatibility checks: 20 passed
  - `npm test`: 64 passed
  - Seeded Chromium grep: 4 passed
  - `git diff --check`: passed with CRLF warnings

## Files Changed

- `docs/qa/HARDCODE_REDUCTION_PLAN.md`
- `docs/qa/HARDCODE_REDUCTION_TRACK.md`

## Next Action

Start Phase 1. Keep behavior unchanged while adding semantic-route guard tests and route-family coverage for the `product-risk` items P0-05, P0-06, and P0-07. Do not begin refactors until the Phase 1 guardrails are in place.
