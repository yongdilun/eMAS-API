# Planner-Owned Agent Loop Migration Progress Tracker

Branch: `codex/playwright-e2e-plan`
Created: 2026-05-20
Last updated: 2026-05-20

Primary plan: [`PLANNER_OWNED_AGENT_LOOP_MIGRATION.md`](PLANNER_OWNED_AGENT_LOOP_MIGRATION.md)

## Purpose

Track implementation progress for the planner-owned agent loop migration without turning the main plan into a work log.

Use the main plan for architecture, contracts, phase definitions, stop conditions, and acceptance criteria. Use this tracker for phase status, commits, verification commands, handoffs, and open follow-up notes.

## Current Status

Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, Phase 4, Phase 5, Phase 6, and Phase 6.5 stabilization are complete. Phase 6.5 retired the Phase 6 baseline full-backend-gate waiver: the full backend suite now passes with project-local absolute temp directories at `877 passed, 3 skipped, 21 xfailed, 1926 warnings`.

Important handoff for Phase 7: Phase 6 added deterministic satisfaction/final validation behind the planner-owned v2 contracts, and Phase 6.5 only stabilized pre-existing full-gate debt. Phase 6.5 does not implement Phase 7 user interrupt or mid-execution replan behavior.

Testing handoff for Phase 5 and later: the main plan now includes a Testing Migration Impact Map. Future phases must update or satisfy that map when they affect hard-query E2E, stateful oracle, response-document UX, RAG/source UX, SSE/timeline, seeded adapter, or hardcode guardrail coverage.

Full-pipeline handoff: Phase 6.5 retired the Phase 6 full backend waiver. Phase 8 should run full backend plus frontend unit/Playwright semantic gates. Phase 9 and Phase 10 should run the full release pipeline. If any full gate is blocked, record the blocker, narrower suite, and deferred owner in this tracker.

## Phase Progress

| Phase | Name | Status | Owner | Commit / PR | Verification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Boundary and baseline audit | Complete | Codex | `4eb425e0b36a32faca6af0ceabe2525a88523939` | `91 passed, 35 warnings`; `git diff --check` passed | Legacy scaffold, RAG shortcut, whole-query tool scope, intent-completion loop, pending-message gap, and ToolSelector reuse boundary documented. |
| 2 | Requirement ledger and v2 state contracts only | Complete | Codex | `feat: add planner-owned loop v2 state contracts` | Phase 1/2 contract suite: `11 passed, 1 warning`; route/splitter/selector suite: `88 passed, 35 warnings`; `git diff --check` passed | Contracts only. Added serializable v2 state, agenda patch locked-constraint guard, adapter trace contracts, and distinct legacy RAG route evidence. No runtime switch or v2/v2_shadow production claim. |
| 3 | Capability map and source-of-truth hints | Complete | Codex | `feat: add planner-owned loop capability map hints` | Phase 1/2/3 contract suite: `21 passed, 1 warning`; route/splitter/selector suite: `88 passed, 35 warnings`; `git diff --check` passed | Added compact metadata-driven capability map helpers, source-of-truth hints, document-knowledge families, field aliases, and requirement sketch/ledger locking. No runtime switch or v2/v2_shadow production claim. |
| 4 | Need-based tool retrieval and hydration | Complete | Codex | `feat: add planner-owned loop capability retriever` | Phase 1/2/3/4 contract suite: `32 passed, 2 warnings`; route/splitter/selector suite: `88 passed, 35 warnings`; `git diff --check` passed | Added contract-only `V2CapabilityToolRetriever` that wraps `ToolSelector`, returns max-5 per-need candidate windows, hydrates only selected cards, traces fallback/failures, and keeps RAG as candidate cards only. |
| 5 | Planner-owned v2 loop behind flag | Complete | Codex | `feat: add planner-owned loop shadow engine` | Phase 1-5 contract suite: `39 passed, 2 warnings`; route/splitter/selector suite: `88 passed, 35 warnings`; `git diff --check` passed | Added `FACTORY_AGENT_ENGINE=legacy|v2_shadow|v2`, shadow trace attachment, direct v2 test path, retriever-backed capability windows, legacy detector flags, and RAG shortcut tracing as legacy evidence. |
| 6 | Evidence satisfaction and replan | Complete | Codex | `ef84d423 feat: add planner-owned loop evidence satisfaction` | Focused Phase 1-6: `49 passed, 2 warnings`; route/splitter/selector: `88 passed, 35 warnings`; full backend waiver recorded for Phase 6 only | Added deterministic satisfaction/final validation. Full backend gate was waived for Phase 6 only because the 16 blockers reproduced on clean Phase 5 commit `b20edc94`; waiver retired by Phase 6.5. |
| 6.5 | Backend gate stabilization | Complete | Codex | `test: stabilize planner-owned loop backend gate` | Full backend with project-local absolute temp: `877 passed, 3 skipped, 21 xfailed, 1926 warnings`; focused Phase 1-6: `49 passed, 2 warnings`; route/splitter/selector: `89 passed, 34 warnings`; `git diff --check` passed | Fixed 15 of the 16 recorded baseline failures and explicitly re-dispositioned the legacy missing-required-args HTTP 400 expectation as strict xfail. Replaced the tactical slot-specific branch with metadata/profile-driven entity-id read selection. No Phase 7 migration behavior added. |
| 7 | User interrupt and mid-execution replan | Planned | TBD | TBD | TBD | Convert `pending_user_message` into real interrupt/replan handling or retire it. |
| 8 | Legacy cleanup switch | Planned | TBD | TBD | TBD | Retire legacy authority only after v2 proofs pass. |
| 9 | Hard query release proof | Planned | TBD | TBD | TBD | Prove multi-step, mixed API/RAG, approval, interrupt, failure, and no-hardcode scenarios. |
| 10 | Legacy kill-switch removal | Planned | TBD | TBD | TBD | Remove normal legacy option only after release proof and cleanup guardrails pass. |

## Audit Notes

- Phase 1 is strongest as documentation and boundary inventory; the guard test is intentionally static and does not prove the future v2 runtime.
- Phase 2 should include `execution_trace` as a first-class contract even though the Phase 2 list in the main plan names only `engine_version`.
- Phase 2 should distinguish `rag_tool` evidence from the current `legacy_rag_route` empty-plan shortcut.
- Phase 2 should keep requirement, capability need, tool call, and evidence vocabularies separate.
- Phase 2 should avoid exact-prompt, seeded-ID, source fixture, or entity-label runtime branches.

## Update Checklist

When a phase is completed:

1. Update `Last updated`.
2. Change the phase status and fill in owner, commit/PR, verification, and notes.
3. Add any handoff notes that affect the next phase.
4. If the phase affects tests, update the Testing Migration Impact Map status in the main plan or add a tracker handoff explaining the remaining coverage gap.
5. Run the Full Pipeline Verification Gate for the phase when applicable, or record the exact blocker and deferred owner.
6. Keep architectural decisions in the main plan, not this tracker.
7. Run `git diff --check`.

## Progress Log

### 2026-05-20

- Phase 1 boundary audit completed and committed in `4eb425e0b36a32faca6af0ceabe2525a88523939`.
- Verification reported: `python -m pytest tests/test_route_to_execution_contract.py tests/test_intent_splitter.py tests/test_tool_selector.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase1_boundary.py -q` passed with `91 passed, 35 warnings`.
- Auditor follow-up identified Phase 2 tracker note: add explicit `execution_trace` contract and legacy RAG shortcut trace support.
- Phase 2 contracts added in `factory_agent/planning/v2_contracts.py` with focused tests in `tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase2_contracts.py`.
- Verification passed: `python -m pytest tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase1_boundary.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase2_contracts.py -q` reported `11 passed, 1 warning`; `python -m pytest tests/test_route_to_execution_contract.py tests/test_intent_splitter.py tests/test_tool_selector.py -q` reported `88 passed, 35 warnings`; `git diff --check` passed.
- Handoff for Phase 3: consume these contracts from metadata/generated capability-map work only; legacy RAG remains represented as `legacy_rag_route` evidence, not `rag_tool`, and production still must not claim `engine_version=v2` or `engine_version=v2_shadow`.
- Phase 3 capability-map helpers added in `factory_agent/planning/v2_capability_map.py` with focused tests in `tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase3_capability_map.py`.
- Verification passed: `python -m pytest tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase1_boundary.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase2_contracts.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase3_capability_map.py -q` reported `21 passed, 1 warning`; `python -m pytest tests/test_route_to_execution_contract.py tests/test_intent_splitter.py tests/test_tool_selector.py -q` reported `88 passed, 35 warnings`; `git diff --check` passed.
- Handoff for Phase 4: use the compact capability hints and requirement sketches as inputs, keep document knowledge as capability families until a real RAG tool retriever is implemented, and reuse the existing `ToolSelector` stack for need-based retrieval.
- Phase 4 need-based retriever added in `factory_agent/planning/v2_tool_retriever.py` with focused tests in `tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase4_tool_retriever.py`.
- Verification passed: `python -m pytest tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase1_boundary.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase2_contracts.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase3_capability_map.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase4_tool_retriever.py -q` reported `32 passed, 2 warnings`; `python -m pytest tests/test_route_to_execution_contract.py tests/test_intent_splitter.py tests/test_tool_selector.py -q` reported `88 passed, 35 warnings`; `git diff --check` passed.
- Handoff for Phase 5: consume `V2CapabilityToolRetriever` only behind the explicit engine flag, record per-need retrieval traces in `v2_shadow`, keep shadow mode trace-only/non-mutating, and continue to distinguish v2 `rag_tool` candidate/evidence contracts from the legacy `legacy_rag_route`.
- Plan coverage improved with a Testing Migration Impact Map that ties the migration to the hard-query E2E, stateful oracle, response-document UX, RAG/source UX, SSE/timeline, seeded adapter, hardcode guardrail, and CI/release-lane testing plans.
- Phase 5 shadow engine added in `factory_agent/planning/v2_planner_loop.py`, `factory_agent/config.py`, `factory_agent/services/plan_creation_service.py`, and `factory_agent/services/execution_service.py`, with focused tests in `tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase5_shadow_engine.py`.
- Verification passed: `python -m pytest tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase1_boundary.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase2_contracts.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase3_capability_map.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase4_tool_retriever.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase5_shadow_engine.py -q` reported `39 passed, 2 warnings`; `python -m pytest tests/test_route_to_execution_contract.py tests/test_intent_splitter.py tests/test_tool_selector.py -q` reported `88 passed, 35 warnings`; `git diff --check` passed.
- Handoff for Phase 6: use the Phase 5 v2 state as trace input only. Direct v2 currently creates read-only draft steps for tests and records write candidates as dry-run diagnostics; it does not satisfy evidence, execute RAG, commit writes, or replace legacy visible authority.
- Full-pipeline gate added to the main plan. Phase 6 should run the full backend pytest suite after focused verification; Phase 8 should run full backend plus frontend unit/Playwright semantic gates; Phase 9 and Phase 10 should run the full release pipeline.
- Phase 6 implementation added in `factory_agent/planning/v2_satisfaction.py`, `factory_agent/planning/v2_contracts.py`, and `factory_agent/planning/v2_planner_loop.py`, with focused tests in `tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase6_satisfaction.py`.
- Verification passed: `python -m pytest tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase6_satisfaction.py -q` reported `10 passed, 1 warning`.
- Verification passed: `python -m pytest tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase1_boundary.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase2_contracts.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase3_capability_map.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase4_tool_retriever.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase5_shadow_engine.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase6_satisfaction.py -q` reported `49 passed, 2 warnings` on the first Phase 6 draft run.
- Verification passed again: `python -m pytest tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase1_boundary.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase2_contracts.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase3_capability_map.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase4_tool_retriever.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase5_shadow_engine.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase6_satisfaction.py -q` reported `49 passed, 2 warnings`.
- Verification passed: `python -m pytest tests/test_route_to_execution_contract.py tests/test_intent_splitter.py tests/test_tool_selector.py -q` reported `88 passed, 35 warnings` on the first Phase 6 draft run.
- Verification passed again: `python -m pytest tests/test_route_to_execution_contract.py tests/test_intent_splitter.py tests/test_tool_selector.py -q` reported `88 passed, 35 warnings`.
- Full backend gate failed on the preferred command: `python -m pytest -q` reported `16 failed, 855 passed, 3 skipped, 20 xfailed, 1925 warnings, 5 errors`. The errors were Windows temp permission failures for `C:\Users\dilun\AppData\Local\Temp\pytest-of-dilun`.
- Full backend gate rerun with project-local temp failed after the temp blocker was removed: `$env:TMP='.pytest-phase6'; $env:TEMP='.pytest-phase6'; python -m pytest -q` reported `16 failed, 860 passed, 3 skipped, 20 xfailed, 1925 warnings`.
- Remaining full-gate blockers: `tests/test_api_endpoints.py::test_legacy_planner_returns_clarification_when_required_args_missing`, `tests/test_api_endpoints.py::test_legacy_planner_prefers_seed_job_slots_tool_for_slots_intent`, `tests/test_api_endpoints.py::test_langchain_invalid_output_fallback_disabled_rejected_and_not_executable`, `tests/test_api_endpoints.py::test_get_tools_lists_and_scopes`, `tests/test_api_endpoints.py::test_replan_validation_failure_three_times_blocks_and_pushes_dlq`, `tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py::test_so011_no_completion_with_pending_approval_or_before_second_approval`, `tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py::test_so001_cascade_uses_original_state_for_second_approval`, `tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py::test_so041_medium_to_high_then_original_high_to_low`, `tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py::test_priority_cascade_oracles_use_original_state_for_second_write_set[SO-002]`, `tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py::test_priority_cascade_oracles_use_original_state_for_second_write_set[SO-003]`, `tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py::test_priority_cascade_oracles_use_original_state_for_second_write_set[SO-004]`, `tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py::test_priority_cascade_oracles_use_original_state_for_second_write_set[SO-035]`, `tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py::test_so005_second_approval_rejection_stops_without_hidden_commit`, `tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py::test_so006_second_approval_timeout_does_not_mutate_or_complete`, `tests/test_phase5_final_validator.py::test_two_step_priority_cascade_requires_second_langgraph_approval`, and `tests/test_planner.py::test_langgraph_repair_does_not_force_single_entity_followup_for_multi_entity_compound`.
- Full backend gate rerun again with project-local temp after confirming the Phase 6 draft still passed focused suites: `$env:TMP='.pytest-phase6'; $env:TEMP='.pytest-phase6'; python -m pytest -q` reported `16 failed, 860 passed, 3 skipped, 20 xfailed, 1925 warnings`.
- Baseline waiver: the remaining full-gate blockers are waived for Phase 6 only because an audit run reproduced the same representative failures on clean Phase 5 commit `b20edc94`. Waived failures are the 16 listed above. They are not attributed to Phase 6 because the focused Phase 1-6 suite and route/splitter/selector guard pass, and no Phase 6 test appears in the failing set.
- Waiver owner: baseline/full-gate stabilization. Removal gate: resolve the baseline failures, formally xfail them with owner/removal criteria, or explicitly renew the waiver before Phase 7 completion. Phase 7 must not silently inherit this waiver as proof that the full backend gate is healthy.
- Phase 6 was committed as `ef84d423 feat: add planner-owned loop evidence satisfaction`.
- Phase 6.5 reran the full backend gate with project-local absolute temp directories before and after stabilization using:

  ```powershell
  $env:TMP='C:\Users\dilun\OneDrive\Documents\eMas APi\factory-agent\.pytest-phase6'
  $env:TEMP='C:\Users\dilun\OneDrive\Documents\eMas APi\factory-agent\.pytest-phase6'
  New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $env:TMP | Out-Null
  python -m pytest -q
  ```

- Phase 6.5 pre-fix reproduction matched the waived baseline: `16 failed, 860 passed, 3 skipped, 20 xfailed, 1925 warnings`.
- Phase 6.5 fixed 15 recorded baseline failures: `tests/test_api_endpoints.py::test_legacy_planner_prefers_seed_job_slots_tool_for_slots_intent`, `tests/test_api_endpoints.py::test_langchain_invalid_output_fallback_disabled_rejected_and_not_executable`, `tests/test_api_endpoints.py::test_get_tools_lists_and_scopes`, `tests/test_api_endpoints.py::test_replan_validation_failure_three_times_blocks_and_pushes_dlq`, `tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py::test_so011_no_completion_with_pending_approval_or_before_second_approval`, `tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py::test_so001_cascade_uses_original_state_for_second_approval`, `tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py::test_so041_medium_to_high_then_original_high_to_low`, `tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py::test_priority_cascade_oracles_use_original_state_for_second_write_set[SO-002]`, `tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py::test_priority_cascade_oracles_use_original_state_for_second_write_set[SO-003]`, `tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py::test_priority_cascade_oracles_use_original_state_for_second_write_set[SO-004]`, `tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py::test_priority_cascade_oracles_use_original_state_for_second_write_set[SO-035]`, `tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py::test_so005_second_approval_rejection_stops_without_hidden_commit`, `tests/test_langgraph_state_machine_oracles.py::test_so006_second_approval_timeout_does_not_mutate_or_complete`, `tests/test_phase5_final_validator.py::test_two_step_priority_cascade_requires_second_langgraph_approval`, and `tests/test_planner.py::test_langgraph_repair_does_not_force_single_entity_followup_for_multi_entity_compound`.
- Phase 6.5 explicitly re-dispositioned `tests/test_api_endpoints.py::test_legacy_planner_returns_clarification_when_required_args_missing` as strict xfail because the pre-graph HTTP 400 compatibility expectation conflicts with the current graph-native clarification UX, which persists an assistant clarification message and empty plan for the frontend to render.
- Phase 6.5 root fixes: keep inferred read args from overwriting already-planned read args, make entity-id read selection prefer metadata/profile-matched child reads before generic lookup fallbacks, keep missing-machine-id tool listing useful for read intents, count validation failures and push DLQ rows independent of `PLANNING` status, and reject execution for `BLOCKED`/`FAILED` sessions with HTTP 400.
- Verification passed: `python -m pytest tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase1_boundary.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase2_contracts.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase3_capability_map.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase4_tool_retriever.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase5_shadow_engine.py tests/test_planner_owned_loop_phase6_satisfaction.py -q` reported `49 passed, 2 warnings`.
- Verification passed: `python -m pytest tests/test_route_to_execution_contract.py tests/test_intent_splitter.py tests/test_tool_selector.py -q` reported `89 passed, 34 warnings`.
- Verification passed: full backend with the project-local absolute temp command above reported `877 passed, 3 skipped, 21 xfailed, 1926 warnings`.
- Verification passed: `git diff --check` exited 0. Output contained only working-copy LF-to-CRLF normalization warnings.
- Remaining blockers after Phase 6.5: none for the recorded 16-failure baseline. Phase 7 still must implement only its own user-interrupt and mid-execution replan scope.
