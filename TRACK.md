# Playwright E2E Execution Tracker

Created: 2026-05-16

Branch: `codex/playwright-e2e-plan`

Purpose: living tracker for replacing manual chatbot validation with a deterministic Playwright browser E2E pipeline.

## Status Legend

Use one of:

- `Not Started`
- `In Progress`
- `Blocked`
- `Done`

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Status | Owner Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Discovery and risk mapping | Done | Current repo shape, test setup, frontend chat flow, backend/SSE routes, env/auth behavior, and risks were inspected and documented. |
| 1 | Playwright setup and baseline browser tests | Not Started | Next action. Add Playwright to `eMas Front` with a minimal mock Factory Agent server. |
| 2 | Chatbot happy-path E2E tests | Not Started | Depends on Phase 1 setup. |
| 3 | Deterministic mocking for chatbot responses | Not Started | Depends on baseline mock server and happy-path flow. |
| 4 | SSE streaming tests | Not Started | Depends on fixture-driven mock server with real `text/event-stream`. |
| 5 | Failure, timeout, retry, and disconnect scenarios | Not Started | Depends on SSE and fixture framework. |
| 6 | CI integration | Not Started | No root CI config found yet. |
| 7 | Cleanup and replacement of old pipeline | Not Started | Do only after Playwright suite is stable and accepted. |

## Long-Term Scope Strategy

| Stage | Status | Scope | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| L0 Browser smoke | Not Started | App opens, chat opens, composer usable. | First PR-level signal. |
| L1 Deterministic mocked chat | Not Started | REST-backed mocked session/message/plan/execute/snapshot flows. | Primary PR suite for user-visible behavior. |
| L2 Deterministic mocked SSE | Not Started | Real `text/event-stream` from mock server for notification/activity scenarios. | Adds stream lifecycle, chunk order, fallback, and disconnect coverage. |
| L3 Seeded full-stack browser | Not Started | Vite plus seeded Go API and Factory Agent fake planner/model provider. | Scheduled or release-branch gate, not first PR requirement. |
| L4 Production-like release validation | Not Started | Compose/staging with nginx paths, auth mode, polling fallback. | Release candidate gate. |
| L5 Production synthetic monitoring | Not Started | Safe read-only canary prompts and health/latency checks. | Post-deploy monitoring only. |

## First-Wave Scenario Portfolio

Target: about 30 meaningful, non-redundant scenarios. Implement them gradually; do not block the first Playwright merge on completing all 30.

| # | Scenario | Status | Layer |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | App opens dashboard and floating chat control is reachable by an accessible selector. | Not Started | L0 |
| 2 | Chat modal opens and shows empty state plus enabled composer. | Not Started | L0 |
| 3 | New session can be started from the sidebar. | Not Started | L1 |
| 4 | Existing active session is restored from local storage. | Not Started | L1 |
| 5 | User sends "Show status for machine M-CNC-01" and sees final assistant answer. | Not Started | L1 |
| 6 | User asks for low priority jobs and sees a result/table-style answer. | Not Started | L1 |
| 7 | User asks a RAG/LOTO question and sees answer plus source/citation chrome. | Not Started | L1 |
| 8 | Follow-up message after completion creates a second distinct turn. | Not Started | L1 |
| 9 | Plan mode submission preserves mode and produces expected planning/progress copy. | Not Started | L1 |
| 10 | Final assistant text animates to completion before sources/details appear. | Not Started | L1 |
| 11 | Notification SSE `hello` opens, invalidates snapshot, and triggers refresh. | Not Started | L2 |
| 12 | Multiple notification events update in cursor order without duplicate refreshes. | Not Started | L2 |
| 13 | Activity stream emits multiple steps and the activity UI shows them in order. | Not Started | L2 |
| 14 | Final completion arrives through SSE plus snapshot and removes busy UI. | Not Started | L2 |
| 15 | SSE heartbeat frames do not create noisy visible messages. | Not Started | L2 |
| 16 | SSE reconnect uses `Last-Event-ID` and does not duplicate prior activity. | Not Started | L2 |
| 17 | Static bearer token mode disables EventSource and uses polling fallback. | Not Started | L2 |
| 18 | Malformed SSE payload is ignored and the next valid event still updates UI. | Not Started | L2 |
| 19 | SSE connection drops and UI shows snapshot polling fallback diagnostic. | Not Started | L2 |
| 20 | Plan creation returns 503 and UI shows backend unavailable/error state without fake success. | Not Started | L1 |
| 21 | Execute returns 409 once, UI/backend retries, and final response completes. | Not Started | L1 |
| 22 | Snapshot returns session not found and UI recovers to a safe state. | Not Started | L1 |
| 23 | Active session never reaches terminal state before timeout and UI remains honest. | Not Started | L2 |
| 24 | Completed snapshot has empty assistant content and does not show a stale previous answer. | Not Started | L1 |
| 25 | User cancels an active run and final UI returns to idle/cancelled state. | Not Started | L2 |
| 26 | User closes modal or navigates during an active stream and EventSource disconnects. | Not Started | L2 |
| 27 | Approval-required response renders risk summary, preview/table, and Approve/Reject actions. | Not Started | L1 |
| 28 | Approval approve flow resumes and reaches completed final answer. | Not Started | L2/L3 |
| 29 | Approval reject flow returns to idle with rejection state and no fake completion. | Not Started | L2/L3 |
| 30 | Confirmation-required flow shows choices, user selects one, and follow-up execution completes. | Not Started | L2/L3 |

- [ ] Record final replacement decisions in this tracker.

## Current Blockers

- None for planning.

Implementation blockers to resolve in Phase 1:

- Playwright is not currently installed.
- The floating chat button lacks an explicit `aria-label`.
- There is no root CI workflow to extend.
- `eMas Front/playwright-report/` exists but is not ignored in `eMas Front/.gitignore`.

## Open Questions

| Question | Current Answer / Assumption |
|---|---|
| Should browser CI run against real Factory Agent? | No for default CI. Use a deterministic mock Factory Agent server first. Add full-stack as optional/nightly later. |
| Should tests cover legacy Go `/api/v1/ai/chats` UI flow? | Not initially. The visible chat UI uses Factory Agent. Legacy Go chat can remain covered by Go/API tests or a later optional browser track. |
| Should MSW be introduced? | Not recommended now. It is not present and native EventSource streaming is better tested with a real mock HTTP/SSE server. |
| Should Playwright route interception be used? | Yes for small REST-only cases, not as the primary SSE mocking mechanism. |
| Should real LLM calls run in CI? | No. Real LLM/RAG checks remain opt-in because they are nondeterministic and environment-dependent. |

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Put Playwright under `eMas Front`. | The frontend package owns the browser app, npm scripts, Vite server, and package lock. |
| Use a test-only mock Factory Agent HTTP/SSE server. | It matches `VITE_FACTORY_AGENT_BASE_URL`, avoids real LLM calls, and can stream real EventSource frames. |
| Keep existing Go/Python seed pipeline during rollout. | It covers API contracts, seed data, reliability, and backend behavior that Playwright should not replace wholesale. |
| Treat current SSE as snapshot/activity streaming, not token streaming. | The inspected backend streams notification/activity/semantic events; final answer text is snapshot-derived and locally animated. |
| Start with Chromium only. | Reduces initial flake and install cost. Add more browsers after stability. |
| Cap the first browser portfolio at about 30 scenarios. | Keeps the suite meaningful and fast while covering distinct risks instead of prompt variants. |
| Grow from mocked browser tests to seeded full-stack, production-like release validation, then safe synthetic monitoring. | This gives fast PR feedback now while preserving a path to production confidence later. |

## Test Results

No test suite was run during this planning-only task.

Discovery command notes:

- Root `package.json` does not exist; frontend package is `eMas Front/package.json`.
- Root `.github/` does not exist.
- Playwright is not configured as a repo test dependency despite an existing generated `eMas Front/playwright-report/` artifact.

## Files Changed

- `PLAN.md`
- `TRACK.md`

## Next Action

Begin Phase 1:

```powershell
Set-Location "eMas Front"
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
npx playwright install chromium
```

Then add `playwright.config.js`, the minimal mock Factory Agent server, and one baseline app/chat-open browser test.
